            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7696:3"/> often with the terrible threats of the Law, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing promiſes of the Goſpell. That if any came by the miniſtery of the one,<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> to be pricked in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and humbled: he readily, like the good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, powreth in the mollifying and healing oyle of the other, to cure and reuiue them.

            <p>But for as much as in reading the Prophets, ſundry difficulties are met withall, which euery one hath not the skill of himſelfe to diſſolue; it would (as I thinke) be very beneficiall for ſuch, if they had an holy helper, ſuch an one as this, ready at hand:<note place="margin">Iob 33.23.</note>

            <p>Not many yeeres ſince, a Lampe (if I may ſo ſpeake) began to be kindled, for giuing them ſome inſight into the harder paſſages of the Prophets; by tranſlating this Authors Commentaries vpon the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> into Engliſh: but much more cleere would the light haue now ſhined, if thereunto had been added the tranſlation of all his Lectures vpon the Propheſie of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> alſo.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What time Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah began to propheſie.</note>As touching <hi>Ieremiah;</hi> note in the firſt place, that hee began to execute his propheticall office whileſt <hi>Ioſias</hi> the King raigned; namely, in the thirteenth yeere of his raigne. For albeit that King was a ſincere worſhipper of God, yet were things euen then much out of frame, and confuſed: for the booke of the Law was loſt; by means whereof it was eaſie for euery one, at his pleaſure, to broach many wicked errours, quite contrary to true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Neither are we to doubt, but in ſo great a liberty, many (who deſired nothing more than to bring in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions) ſtroue eagerly to peruert and ouerthrow the worſhip of God, and the purity of doctrine: euery one forging to himſelfe many dotages and impieties. For let it be granted that the Prieſts meant faithfully to teach the people of God; yet did not their knowledge depend wholly vpon the Law. Now howſoeuer it be very likely, that the memory therof was not vtterly aboliſhed; yet queſtionleſſe there only remained but ſome few reliques of it, ſo as they could not cleerly gather thence what kind of gouernment it was which God had ordained to be in his Church.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 34.15.</note> For it is recorded in the holy Hiſtory, that the booke of the Law was found in the eighteenth yeere of <hi>Ioſias</hi> his raigne. Thus <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had begun euen now to propheſie, foure, nay fiue yeeres fully compleat. This example then ſufficiently manifeſts what ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and careleſneſſe there is in men, in endeauouring to aduance the true worſhip of God. For hee had giuen an expreſſe charge by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that a copy of the Law ſhould not onely be holily and carefully kept in the Temple; but that the King himſelfe alſo ſhould haue a copy of it by him, Deut. 17.18. Beſides, a commandement was added, that in all their ſolemne feaſts, the whole Law ſhould be repeated in the eares of all the people, Deut. 32.11. But after the Kings began once to reuolt from Gods true worſhip: the copy of the Law was no more entertained among them: and at length, euen the Law alſo it ſelfe was vtterly loſt. No doubt but this happened
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7696:8"/> through the tyranny of King <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> who exerciſed his cruelties no leſſe vpon the Prieſts, than vpon the reſt of Gods ſeruants. For no ſooner brake any ſmall ſparkle of light forth, but he made ſuch a ſlaughter, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed blood to runne through all the ſtreets of Ieruſalem, as the ſacred hiſtory teſtifies, 2. King. 21.16. What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is it then, if he tooke and conueyed euen out of the Temple it ſelfe, all the written copies of the Law which were extant, that ſo he might vtterly extinguiſh all light of heauenly doctrine? Notwithſtanding the booke which had bin hidden, was found againe by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Prieſt,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 34.15.</note> as it is alſo recited in the chapter formerly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. This is it wee haue to note then in the firſt place, from the circumſtance of time, wherein <hi>Ieremiah</hi> began to propheſie. For religion being thus corrupted, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one taking vpon him to forge what errours ſoeuer him liſted: the charge impoſed vpon the Prophet, muſt of neceſſity be very irkſome to him, or burthenſome for him to beare.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we are alſo to note the end. He ſaith,<note place="margin">How long Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied.</note> that from this time he continued in executing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall office vntill the captiuity of Babylon: hee held on his courſe then for the ſpace of 40. yeeres. Now in the progreſſe of his booke we ſhall better perceiue, what and how ſharpe the conflicts were, which he was faine to vndergoe. But put the caſe the people had been much more teachable than they were, yet could not hee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his charge enioyned him by God, without extreame griefe, and alſo like tediouſneſſe. For we ſhall ſee anon, what the ſumme of his meſſage was with which he was ſent. Seeing then he continued theſe his painfull labours,<note place="margin">Ieremiahs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, noted.</note> fortie yeeres together: thence it is eaſie to iudge with what an heroicall ſpirit hee was endowed. Moreouer, if wee ſeriouſly conſider, what, and how many tempeſts were daily raiſed vp againſt him, vtterly to diſ-hearten him, yea wholly to turne him out of the right way: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo will his inuincible conſtancy, and ardent zeale,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7696:9"/> ſhine yet more cleerely vnto vs, in that he yet ceaſed not ſtill to goe on in thoſe duties which he was to performe. Therewithall alſo we are to note, that from the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City, after which the inhabitants of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem were carried away captiue into Babylon; that euen then <hi>Ieremiah</hi> deſiſted not.<note place="margin">Ieremiah car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into Egypt of the Iewes by force.</note> For he was led into Egypt, as it may eaſily be gathered out of the end of this booke; and eſpecially from the 44. chapter: yea he was violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led thither, albeit he had (from the mouth of the Lord) curſed all the Iewes who ſought lurking holes in Egypt. Now when himſelfe was thus conſtrained to goe downe thither, this might much diminiſh his authority: for the wicked (as we know) watch at euery turne to eſpie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions how they may diſgrace and ſlander the ſeruants of God. Neither might they ſeeme to want ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretext in this behalfe: Ho, this fellow hath curſed all ſuch as goe downe into Egypt. But (I pray you) where dwelles hee himſelfe now? Euen in Egypt, with the reſt that are fled thither. Neither is it to be doubted, but the faith of this holy man was much aſſailed, by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe, and the like ieſts vpon him; for as much as impiety hath euermore gone hand in hand with pride and arrogancy: yet there, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> conſtantly perſiſted in his courſe, yea euen till the city was raſed. And it is like enough he continued his labours in teaching, more than fiftie yeeres.<note place="margin">Ieremiah ſtoned to death, as it is thought.</note> It is ſaid by ſome, that he was ſtoned to death: and this is very likely; for hee ceaſed not ſtill to enuay as vehemently againſt the Iewes, which were fled into Egypt, as he did during the time that the City was in ſafety. Now they were at that time enraged with an extreame deſperateneſſe. Thence it came to paſſe then that they ſlew the holy Prophet, which (in their conceit) they thought they might lawfully doe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he inſulted ouer them (as it were) in their miſeries: but he endeauored rather thereby to tame their pride and rebellion, which was indeed now become incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but as for them they tooke it not ſo.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:7696:9"/>
               <p>I come now to the ſumme of the propheſie:<note place="margin">The ſumme of Ieremiahs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</note> For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets that liued in thoſe times, had (for the moſt part) loſt their labour, and ſpent their ſtrength in vaine, what remained vnto <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then, but in few words to pronounce this ſentence: <hi>Hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more grace nor pardon, for the time of the laſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is at hand, in regard you haue too long abuſed Gods patience, who hitherto hath forborne you, and with all mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and long-ſuffering hath exhorted you to repentance, and hath teſtified, that he would deale fauourably and graciouſly with you, if ſo be you would conuert &amp; turn into the right way</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then Gods mercy hauing by them been deſpiſed, it was requiſite <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſhould thus thunder againſt ſuch kind of perſons, who by their obſtinacy (in ſuch a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate rebellion) were growne incurable. Now yee ſee whereunto the ſumme of this doctrine principally tends; namely to ſhew, that the kingdome and prieſthood were at an end, becauſe the Iewes had ſo long a time together, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and after ſo many waies kindled Gods wrath againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them, and had alſo reiected the holy admonitions of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſeruants. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had in like manner threatned them in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> time: but to mitigate theſe feares and terrours, wee ſee there are alwaies left in his propheſies ſome hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: ſo that as oft as he enuayes in the bittereſt manner againſt them, yet he forthwith addes ſome word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Now after the ten tribes were led into captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that their kingdome was waſted, and yet the Iewes (notwithſtanding all this) repented not; nay, they became worſe and worſe in hardening their hearts againſt Gods rods and ſcourges. Was it not needfull (as I haue ſaid before) that he ſhould take them ſhort, and handle them more ſeuerely? God had contended and pleaded with the Iewes by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and by other of his Prophets; by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> he wholly conuinced them as guilty, and alſo pronounced ſentence of condemnation vpon them. This is the difference which is to bee noted, betweene the forme of doctrine which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> held, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7696:10"/> that which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> kept in his Sermons.</p>
               <p>And yet to the end nothing might be wanting to his doctrine, it pleaſed God that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> alſo ſhould be an Herald and a publiſher of his grace, and of that ſaluation promiſed by Ieſus Chriſt. But this exception muſt neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe bee retained; to wit, that hee giues no hope of<note n="*" place="margin">That is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of being freed from their <hi>70.</hi> yeeres cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity.</note> pardon or mercy, till after they ſhould be chaſtiſed and corrected for their offences. Now then we ſee what <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> principaly taught. But the whole, will be better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the readers, and more diſtinctly perceiued by the continuall progreſſe of the Text. Neither is it my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe now to ſhew in generall what is to be ſought in the Prophet (for this argument (as I take it) is handled elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) I onely affirme then,<note place="margin">See his preface before Iſaiah.</note> that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was ſent of God to preach and publiſh to the people their laſt ruine: and then, to declare the redemption to come: yet ſo, as that ſtill he placeth the captiuity of 70. yeeres betweene. I come now to the words.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Saint Ierome.</note> is altogether friuolous; in regard that from the words which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet addes a little after, hee gathers,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.7.</note> that hee was but a child when he began to propheſie: as if he gaue not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe this title <hi>by way of ſimilitude.</hi> It is vncertaine in what time of his age hee was called to his propheticall office: yet it is probable that he was then come to mans eſtate, becauſe it was needfull hee ſhould bee furniſhed with more than ordinary authority. Moreouer, had hee been young, or a <hi>child,</hi> vndoubtedly hee would not haue concealed ſo great and excellent a miracle, but would haue ſhewed how he was created a Prophet, before he attained to a ſufficient ripeneſſe of yeeres.</p>
                  <p>As touching his <hi>father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of what ſtocke Ieremiah came.</note> it is no maruell if the Iewes transferre this name to the high Prieſt: for wee know how they are alwaies rapt vp (as it were) in their vaine braggings. In as much then as ambition poſſeſſeth their hearts, hence it is they haue affirmed, that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was the <hi>ſonne</hi> of the high Prieſt, and all (forſooth) that they might adde the more pompe and glory to this eſtate. But what teſtifies the Prophet himſelfe? Truly hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes he was <hi>the ſonne of Hilkiah;</hi> but ye heare him not ſay his father was the high Prieſt. Nay, hee rather addes, <hi>of the Prieſts which were at Anathoth, in the land of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7696:11"/> But we know that Anathoth was a little village,<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.30.</note> of ſmall eſteeme, not farre off from the City of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Alſo <hi>Ieremiah</hi> himſelfe reports, that it was ſituate <hi>in the tribe of Beniamin.</hi> We may gather from the words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that it was neere to Ieruſalem, when he ſaith, that <hi>poore Anathoth</hi> was afraid, Iſa. 10.30. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> there threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Ieruſalem, in regard the enemy was neare; ſaying, what is your confidence? For from your gates you may heare the cry of the enemie, and the lamentations of your brethren. For Anathoth is not very farre from you, to wit, onely three miles. Seeing then <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſaith plainly he was borne in the village of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> why ſhould we imagine hee was the ſonne of the hie Prieſt? And as idle a conceit is that which the Calde paraphraſt addes; namely,<note place="margin">The Calde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſt.</note> That the poſſeſſion of <hi>Helkiah</hi> was in the towne of Anathoth: as if (forſooth) it had been permitted to the Prieſt to poſſeſſe fields. God had onely aſſigned that which was ſufficient to feed their cattell with, Numb. 35.2.3.4. Let vs then follow that which is certaine, and that which is without controuerſie, which alſo may well bee collected from the words of the Prophet, namely, <hi>That hee was borne and bred in the poore village of Anathoth:</hi> and yet he affirmes he was of the ſtocke and <hi>linage of the Prieſts.</hi> His propheticall office then we ſee might much better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to his perſon, than to other of the Prophets; as to <hi>Amos,</hi> or <hi>Iſaiah, Iſaiah</hi> was plucked from the Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of the royall blood, and was ordained a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. The ſame for diuers reſpects may bee ſaid of <hi>Amos.</hi> For he was taken from the folds of beaſts, being a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, or heard man, Amos 7.14. When God deputed ſuch for Prophets in his Church, it is moſt certaine hee meant thereby to reproach the Prieſts with their ſloth and careleſneſſe. For albeit all the Prieſts were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet were they thence to bee taken: for the prieſtly ſtate was (as it were) a ſeminary of the Prophets. But there being in them a kind of brutiſhneſſe, and as groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as might be, God choſe Prophets elſewhere, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7696:11"/> thus diſcouered and brought their ſhame to light. For it was their parts to haue been the meſſengers of the Lord of hoſts: the cuſtodie of the Law ought to haue been in their lips, that at their mouth the people might go to ſeek the Law, Mal. 2.7. In regard then that they were dumbe dogs, God cauſed the honour of the propheticall office to be transferred ouer vnto others. But <hi>Ieremiah</hi> (as I haue already ſaid) who was a Prieſt, was alſo therewithall a Prophet.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond verſe, he begins to ſpeake of his calling.<note place="margin">Of Ieremiahs calling.</note> For it would haue been too bare and naked, if onely at the firſt entrance hee had affirmed that hee came and brought a meſſage: but in the ſecond verſe he more fully ſhewes hee brought nothing but that which was giuen him in charge <hi>from God:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I haue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deliuered that (as it were from hand to hand) which God hath enioyned me. For wee know that God onely hath all authority in himſelfe, when the matter concernes the doctrine of piety and religion; neither in deed apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it to mortall men to forge this or that according to their owne appetites, thereby to ſubiect the faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. Seeing then that God is the onely maſter and teacher in his Church:<note place="margin">God the onely maſter &amp; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Church.</note> whoſoeuer ſeekes or deſires to be heard there, he muſt of neceſſity approoue himſele to be the miniſter and ſeruant of God.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> carefully here doth, when he ſaith in verſ. 4. <hi>That the word of the Lord was giuen him.</hi> Hee ſaith before, <hi>The words of Ieremiah, the ſonne of Hilkiah.</hi> But ſome one might reply; yea it may be, the meaneſt of the people: How haſt thou intruded thy ſelfe? Is it fit wee ſhould heare a mortall man? Doth not God reſerue this prerogatiue to himſelfe alone? <hi>Ieremiah</hi> therefore (as it were by way of correction) addes here, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>his words:</hi> not that he is <hi>the author</hi> of them; but <hi>the meſſenger,</hi> or ambaſſadour onely.<note place="margin">Ieremiah a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, before he was a teacher.</note> Hee affirmes then that he onely executes that which God had enioyned him. Why ſo? Becauſe he was firſt Gods Diſciple, before hee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7696:12"/> tooke vpon him the office of teaching. As touching that which appertaines to the <hi>beginning, and end of time:</hi> the cauſe is briefly noted why he ſaith, <hi>hee was choſen to be a Prophet in the thirteenth yeere of Ioſias, and that he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this his function to the eleuenth yeere of Zedekias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How Amon is ſaid to be father to Ioſias.</note>Whereas <hi>Ioſias is called the ſonne of Amon,</hi> ſome doubt whether truly and properly <hi>Ioſias</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Amon.</hi> For in the yeere 22. <hi>Amon</hi> began to raigne, and raigned onely two yeeres. <hi>Ioſias</hi> ſucceeded in his place when hee was eight yeeres of age. If we preciſely count the yeeres, and that <hi>Ioſias</hi> was begotten in the ſixteenth yeere, then it will ſeeme abſurd that <hi>Amon</hi> ſhould be a father before the ſixteenth yeere: for it muſt needs be, that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the fifteenth yeere. Hence we probably gather, that <hi>Amon</hi> was his legall, but not his naturall father: as afterwards, <hi>Zedechias</hi> is called the ſonne of <hi>Ioſias,</hi> becauſe he was his ſucceſſor; although he was his nephew by the brothers ſide, as many thinke. But this is a thing vſuall euery where, that ſuch are called <hi>the children,</hi> or ſonnes of Kings, which haue ſucceeded them; and who were ſo le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, and not naturally, as I haue ſaid.

                     <hi>IEremiah</hi> proſecutes that more at large here, which hee touched erewhile; namely, that he was called of God: for otherwiſe he had raſhly thruſt in himſelfe. We know that none takes this honour to himſelfe (as the Apoſtle ſaith) but Gods calling onely exalts men to the office of Prophets and teachers.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note> That <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure diligent attention from his auditors, hee boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerres, that he had <hi>a calling</hi> to this propheticall function: yea, and that <hi>immediately from Gods owne voice.</hi> To this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7696:12"/> purpoſe it is he ſaith, that <hi>the word was giuen him.</hi> And, <hi>that before God formed him in the wombe, he knew him.</hi> Hee brings in God ſpeaking then, that the word might haue the greater emphaſis; that is, that it might haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waight and vehemency. For had he made a bare nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his <hi>owne perſon,</hi> and told how he was ordained a Prophet by the voice of God; this would not ſo much haue affected the mindes of his hearers. But when hee brings in <hi>God ſpeaking,</hi> neceſſity requires, that there ſhould be greater waight and force in this manner of ſpeech. I now omit the full handling of this poynt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a calling is requiſite to a Miniſter, that he may be heard of Gods people: for, none ought to attribute to himſelfe authority to ſpeake in the congregation; as if either it appertained to him by inheritance, or as hauing ability of himſelfe, as I haue ſaid; becauſe God reſerues this as peculiar to himſelfe alone. But I haue elſe where entreated at large of the calling of the Prophets; and therefore it ſufficeth for the preſent that I haue poynted to the matter, or rather, to the ſumme of theſe things as with the finger. Beſides, theſe things may be found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tracts, or common places. For if I ſhould ſtand to diſcuſſe euery poynt to the ful in euery chapter,<note place="margin">The cauſe of Maſter Caluins breuity in his Commentaries and lectures.</note> we ſhould neuer make an end. I haue therefore determined (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my ordinary cuſtome) to runne ouer this Prophet briefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieremiah</hi> declares then, <hi>that he was called of God,</hi> to the end the people might yeeld him that attention which was meet. Now concerning the words, God teſtifies, <hi>that hee knew Ieremiah before he formed him in the wombe.</hi> This is not ſpoken ſo particularly of this Prophet, as if other men were therfore <hi>vnknowne</hi> to God: but this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to his office and charge impoſed vpon him; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Before I formed thee in the wombe. I or-ordained thee for thee for this purpoſe;</hi> namely, <hi>that the office of teaching my people ſhould be committed to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond part of the verſe there is a repetition,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7696:13"/> when hee ſaith, <hi>before thou cameſt foorth of thy mothers wombe, I ſanctified thee.</hi> This <hi>ſanctification</hi> then, and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God are all one. Thus we ſee that by <hi>knowledge</hi> in this place, is not onely meant foreknowledge, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, by which God chuſeth men according to his good pleaſure, and therewithall alſo ordaineth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſanctifieth them. For no man naturally is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for theſe things: as <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, in 2. Cor. 2.16. Seeing then this faculty depends vpon Gods free gift, what maruell is it if God affirmes, <hi>that hee ſanctified Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I not onely formed thee a man in the wombe of thy mother, but therewithall I ſet thee apart to a ſpeciall vſe: and becauſe thou couldeſt not come furniſhed thence with ſuch an excellency, as to bee able to exerciſe the office of a Prophet; therefore I alſo formed thee a Prophet; and not a man ſimply and onely.</hi> This is the ſumme.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe reaſon too ſubtilly, who thinke that the Prophet was indeed ſanctified from the wombe of his mother,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.15.</note> as <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was; for the words ſound nothing alike: onely <hi>Ieremiah</hi> teſtifies that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.15.</note> which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes of himſelfe in the firſt of the Galatians; to wit, <hi>that God knew him before he was borne. Ieremiah</hi> then was not in deed <hi>ſanctified in the wombe,</hi> but <hi>in Gods predeſtination, and in his ſecret counſell:</hi> yea before ſuch time as God then choſe him to bee his Prophet.

Firſt, that hee might free himſelfe from all ſuſpition of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> raſhneſſe: for we know how much this deſire of bearing rule raignes among men, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> alſo ſpeakes. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would faine be maſters ouer others,</hi> Iam. 3.1.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7696:14"/> them this office of teaching: (yea would to God many did not violently ſnatch it vnto them) therefore <hi>Ieremiah</hi> that he might eſcape the imputation of one that ranne before he was ſent, <hi>affirmes he was conſtrained to take it of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> neceſſity.</hi> Secondly, therewithall alſo he gets to himſelfe the more reuerence, and makes his ſcholers ſo much the more attentiue. For why refuſeth hee to obey Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when he is called to his prophetical office? ſurely the difficulties therof, feared him.

Why ſo? Becauſe it was not his purpoſe either to contemne his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">Reaſons why Ieremiah excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to follow Gods calling.</note> or to free himſelfe from his obedience, nor to caſt off the yoke, that he might take his eaſe, or that hee might winne credit, or enioy the preſent commodities of this life: <hi>Ieremiah</hi> regarded none of theſe things; but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into himſelfe, he concluded he was vtterly vnable to vndergoe ſo burthenſome and cumberſome a charge. This excuſe then is added, onely by way of a modeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.

               <p>This word <hi>child</hi> then, is taken here <hi>by way of ſimilitude:</hi> for the Prophet confeſſeth hee is neither expert enough, nor acquainted with ſuch a charge. For (as I haue ſaid) ſome too fondly reſtraine this to his age: albeit then her was already of ſufficient yeeres for ſuch a buſineſſe: yet becauſe he was neither qualified with knowledge, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts neceſſary for ſo excellent a function; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith, <hi>I am a child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followes the anſwere. <hi>Say not, I am a child, for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7696:15"/> thou ſhalt goe, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Lord not onely foretels what the Prophet ſhould doe; but tels him his errand, and what is required of him: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>Thou muſt obey my voyce; for I haue authority to command thee: goe therefore thou muſt, whitherſoeuer I ſhall ſend thee: and publiſh thou muſt, all that I command thee.</hi> In which words God aduertizeth his ſeruant <hi>that the conceit of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability</hi> muſt not aſtoniſh him: for it ſufficeth him <hi>ſimply to yeeld his obedience to this commandement.</hi> And as this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is moſt profitable, ſo is it worthy to be well known and vnderſtood: for as it is vnlawfull for any to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ought, before he hath conſidered well of his owne ability: ſo on the other ſide, <hi>when God enioynes vs any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; with cloſed eyes let vs forthwith obey his voyce.</hi> Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is a vertue worthily commendable in all ſuch as take vpon them to write any thing: which alſo may bee extended generally to all others, namely, what fitneſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one hath, or what his ſholders are able to beare, as they ſay. For whence comes ſo great audacity and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardineſſe in many, but from being puffed vp with a fond ouerweening, which in the end proues their owne ruine? wherefore in all actions,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the right and orderly beginning is, that euery one take a ſuruey of his owne abilities; and that he thenceforth carry himſele with a low ſaile, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of his gifts and capacity. Thus ſhould we haue none that would raſhly intrude himſelfe into callings, nor yet arrogate to himſelfe more than is meet. But when <hi>God calleth vs,</hi> what though we be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of gifts? we muſt (for all that) <hi>yeeld our obedience.</hi> Which doctrine is plainly gathered from theſe words, where God ſaith, <hi>Say not, I am a child:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou feeleſt thy ſelfe farre ſhort in gifts; albeit thou art well acquainted with thine owne inſufficiencies: yet ſhalt thou goe notwithſtanding all this:</hi> that is, <hi>of neceſſity thou muſt diſpatch the errand whereon I ſend thee.</hi> For this is that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which God ſimply requires of vs; namely, that howſoeuer we finde our ſelues deſtitute of gifts to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7696:15"/> the thing giuen in charge: yet that we may readily yeeld our obedience to his Commandements.</p>

                  <p>FRom this verſe we may gather, that <hi>Ieremiah was much perplexed,</hi> whileſt he ſaw himſelfe called to ſo tedious and painfull conflicts, in regard hee had not yet attained ſuch power and magnanimity of minde, that without quailing he durſt conſtantly ſet vpon ſo many and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aduerſaries. For he ſaw well enough that hee had to deale with a degenerate people: and to ſay the truth, all of them (in a manner) had ſwarued and declined from Gods Law: ſo as now hauing a long time reiected that yoke, they began to inſult with ſuch fury and rebellion, that they could very hardly bee brought backe to true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and moderation. It appeares then that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was thus with-held, by reaſon of theſe difficulties; and therefore durſt not vndertake his propheticall office For (no doubt) God heere applies vnto him <hi>a fit remedy againſt his faint-heartedneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what ſaith he? <hi>Feare not their faces.</hi> For when <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſaid <hi>he was a child,</hi> hee looked (as I noted ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while) to this difficulty; namely, That hee was no way able to ſuſtaine thoſe ſharpe conflicts which preſented themſelues before him, if hee once began to encounter with this rebellious people, who were now growne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hardened in their bad and euill courſes. See then how hee would faine haue <hi>wound himſelfe out, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himſelfe of this burthen impoſed vpon him;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard hee durſt not frankly and freely (before all men) in plaine tearmes profeſſe how all matters ſtood: but God who ſearcheth into mens hearts, and findes out all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intentions thereof, <hi>remedies his feare,</hi> when hee ſaith vnto him, <hi>feare not their faces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, this place ſhewes vnto vs, that euen then, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7696:16"/> ſo raigned among this elect people, that none of Gods ſeruants might quietly execute their office. For if the Prophets and teachers had had to deale with a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people, there had needed <hi>no feare of quarrels,</hi> nor combats: but where the feare and reuerence of God is wanting; yea, when men are ouer-carried by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their paſſions and luſts, there can no faithfull teacher duly diſcharge his duty, vnleſſe he bee armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand to the fight. This is it then which God ſignifies, when hee willes his Prophet <hi>to bee bold and fearleſſe:</hi> to wit, in regard he well foreſaw there were as many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as there were men, who bragged they were the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the reaſon of this confident boldneſſe is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which is added in the next words, <hi>Becauſe I am with thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to deliuer thee.</hi> For by theſe words the Lord aduertiſeth him, that hee hath ſufficient defence in his owne hand and power; leſt the Prophet ſhould feare the furie and rage of thoſe of his nation. I grant that from the very firſt entrance, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had cauſe enough to feare, in ſeeing that he had to ſtriue, not with two or three, but with the generall ſtate of the kingdome: but <hi>God</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>him ſelfe alone,</hi> to all theſe mortall men, and ſaith, <hi>I am with thee, and therefore feare not.</hi> By this then it is plaine, that we then render to God that honour which to him appertaines,<note place="margin">How to yeeld God his due honour.</note> when (contenting our ſelues <hi>with his onely protection,</hi> and ſafegard) we boldly deſpiſe all the men of this world; not fearing to fight againſt the whole rabble of the wicked, albeit they band themſelues againſt vs by great troups: yea, be their power and ſorces neuer ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, let vs notwithſtanding aſſure our ſelues, that the onely protection of God is ſufficient to maintaine vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame.

                     <hi>IEremiah</hi> here comes againe to ſpeake of his vocation,<note place="margin">Ieremiah men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the third time.</note> that his doctrine might not be contemned, as if it came from a priuate or particular perſon. Hee proteſts once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine then, that he came not of his owne proper mouing; but that he was ſent to teach, with authority <hi>from God.</hi> To which purpoſe it is he ſaith, <hi>that the words of God were put into his mouth.</hi> This place ought diligently to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; becauſe the Prophet in few words declares whence the certainty of a lawfull vocation is to be fetched, when any mindes to take vpon him the office of teaching in the Church; namely, that he bring nothing of his owne: as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo teacheth in his Canonicall Epiſtle. 4.11. <hi>Let him that ſpeakes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſpeake as the words of God;</hi> that is to ſay, let him not ſpeake doubtfully, as if hee broached his owne deuices; but that which he may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without wauering, deliuer in the name of God. Thus doth <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in this place; for before he deſires to be heard, <hi>he affirmes that the words of God were put into his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs aſſure our ſelues then,<note place="margin">God onely is to be heard in his Church.</note> that whatſoeuer proceeds from mans braine, may lawfully be reiected. Why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath reſerued this honour as peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to bee heard in his Church, as wee ſaid yeſterday. Whence it followes, that none are to bee held for Gods ſeruants, nor to bee reputed faithfull Prophets and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church, but thoſe by whoſe mouth God ſpeakes; that nothing be forged out of the ſhop of their owne braines, nor ought to be taught there according to their carnall appetites; but that they faithfully bring and publiſh that which God hath deliuered vnto them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>viſible ſigne</hi> was added, the better to confirme the thing it ſelfe. True it is, that this muſt not bee drawne to a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7696:17"/> generall rule; as if it were neceſſary that God ſhould ſtill <hi>touch the lips and tongues of all Miniſters with his hand:</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but two things are heere expreſſed; to wit, the action it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſelfe, and the outward ſigne. As touching <hi>the action,</hi> it is a law impoſed vpon all Gods ſeruants, that they bring not in their owne inuentions, but onely deliuer that from hand to hand, which they haue receiued of God.</p>
                  <p>But this was particular in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> that God hauing ſtretched foorth his hand, touched his mouth: thereby plainly ſhewing, <hi>that the Prophets mouth was conſecrated to his owne vſe.</hi> It ſufficeth the Miniſters of the word then, <hi>that their tongues</hi> be dedicated vnto God; that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle not their dreames nor fancies with his pure truth. But in the perſon of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> God meant alſo to adde <hi>the viſible ſigne</hi> thereof; <hi>when hee ſtretched out his hand to touch his mouth.</hi> Now God hauing teſtified that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the <hi>tongue</hi> of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was conſecrated and ſeparated from common and prophane vſes, in the next words hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> giues him power and authority: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>this day I haue ſet thee ouer nations, and ouer kingdomes.</hi> In which words, God ſhewes with what reuerence hee would haue his word to be receiued; yea euen then, when it is preached vnto vs by mortall men. For where is the man that will not brag of his obedience towards God? But in the meane while, ſcarce an hundred for one, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth his word. For he no ſooner ſpeakes, but all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (in a manner) murmure: or rather, if they dare not furiouſly oppoſe againſt him as open enemies; yet wee ſee notwithſtanding, how ſome ſhift off the matter by wranglings: others, howſoeuer they be ſilent peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in words, yet reſiſt him, and his word, in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. This authority then which God attributes to his word, is to be marked, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I haue ſet thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nations and kingdomes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when he ſaith, <hi>Behold I haue ſet thee,</hi> hee therein exhorts the Prophet to be of good courage, that hee bethinke himſelfe well of his vocation, that neither
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7696:17"/> daſtardly nor ſeruilely he ſeeme to flatter men; nor yet to beare with them in their luſts. <hi>See</hi> (ſaith he): By this word, note, that Miniſters cannot execute their office as they ought, vnleſſe they ſet the Maieſty of God before their eyes; ſo as in reſpect of that, they ſcorne whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer glory, power or pompe it be in men, that may ſeeme to dazle their ſight. For experience it ſelfe teacheth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that we no ſooner begin to haue mens perſons in eſtimation, but we are forthwith ſurpriſed with a fearfulneſſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them. To what purpoſe are Prophets and teachers ſent then? Euen to reduce the whole world into a right order; that they ſpare not their auditors, but that they frankly and freely reprooue them as oft as need requires; yea, menace and threaten them, as oft as they ſee them grow headſtrong and obſtinate. Let there bee but ſome outward ſhew of excellency in men, and you ſhal ſee, that the teacher will not dare to offend ſuch; becauſe hee ſees them to bee endowed with power, riches, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for their wiſedome; but eſpecially if they bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to high honours. What other remedie is left then, but that the teachers propoſe <hi>Gods authority</hi> before their eyes; being alſo fully reſolued that they ſpeake in his name? And thus (with an inuincible magnanimity of mind) they ſhall deſpiſe whatſoeuer loftineſſe or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency appeares in any mortall man. Now ye ſee the ſcope and drift of this word <hi>See,</hi> or behold; which God vſeth, <hi>See</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Behold, I haue ſet thee ouer nations, and ouer kingdomes.</hi> Heere God further teſtifies, that there ſhines ſuch authority in his word, that it brings all loftineſſe and greatneſſe downe to the ground: yea, that <hi>Kings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are not exempt out of the reach of it: what God hath ioyned together then, let not man ſeparate, Matth. 19.6. Mark. 10.9. True it is that God heere extolles his prophets, and exalts them <hi>aboue the whole world;</hi> yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Kings of the eatth: but hee ſaid but erewhile,<note place="margin">See verſ. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Behold I haue put my words in thy mouth.</hi> It is neceſſary then, that if any will chalenge to himſelfe power and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7696:18"/> greatneſſe of authority aboue others, that hee haue Gods word for his warrant, and that hee manifeſt himſelfe a Prophet by ſome good effects; broaching none of his owne deuices nor imaginations. Heere then (I pray you) take a view of the Popes inſolency,<note place="margin">The Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency noted.</note> and of the impudency of his Clergie; when ſo malipertly they dare ſnatch to themſelues that which is here ſaid: We are (ſay they) ſet ouer Kings and nations. By what law? God hath ſo told vs by his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> But yet of friendſhip take all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with you: <hi>I haue put my words in thy mouth, and haue ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thee ouer nations and kingdomes.</hi> Now let the Pope ſhew his warrant from Gods word, vſurping nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in particular. In a word, let him bring in none of his dreames, and we will willingly yeeld him this ſupremacy aboue all the world: for God and his word muſt neuer be ſundred. As Gods Maieſty is eminent aboue the whole world, yea, aboue the Angels of heauen; ſo is there the like ſoueraignty which alwayes goes with the word. But ſeeing theſe ſwine, and maſtiffe curres, are void both of all found doctrine, and piety: what ſhameleſneſſe, or rather fooliſhneſſe is it in them, to brag <hi>of their ſoueraignty ouer Kings and nations?</hi> To bee ſhort; this text teacheth, that <hi>men</hi> are not aduanced heere, albeit they be the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the word of life; but rather <hi>the word</hi> and doctrine it ſelfe. God then (you ſee) attributes the ſoueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>to his word;</hi> howſoeuer the Miniſters thereof bee poore, baſe, and contemptible; and albeit there appeares neither pompe nor glory in them. But I haue told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why this clauſe is added; namely, that the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and teachers may come furniſhed with valour and courage: and thus may not feare boldly to ſet themſelues both againſt <hi>Kings, and nations;</hi> being armed and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the power of the heauenly doctrine.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he addes, <hi>To plucke vp, to deſtroy, to breake downe, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeemes heere as if God of ſet purpoſe meant to make both his word, and the miniſtery of his ſeruant, odious at the very firſt entrance. For how could
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7696:18"/> the word of the Lord bee amiable in the mouth of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> vnleſſe the Iewes perceiued that it was publiſhed for their ſaluation?

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet afterwards he addes, <hi>To build, and to plant.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ward hath a double vſe.</note> God then attributes <hi>a double vſe</hi> vnto his word.

For impiety, rebellion, and deſperate obſtinacy had already (for a long time) gotten ſuch head, that it was needfull he ſhould begin with <hi>ruine, deſtruction,</hi> and ſuch like things. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then could not <hi>plant,</hi>

                     <hi>nor build the temple of God,</hi> before <hi>he ouerthrew, plucked vp, and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe the diuell had erected his throne, or palace there. For religion hauing been deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, many yeeres together: then the diuell (as if he had been enthronized into his tribunall ſeat) raigned in Ieruſalem, and in the whole land of Iudeah, without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. How could <hi>Gods temple</hi> then be erected, in which he might be purely ſerued, vnleſſe theſe ruines preceded? Thus the diuell had corrupted the whole land. For (as we know) all ſinnes and iniquities raigned therein ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as if the land had been repleniſhed with thornes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7696:19"/> and bryars. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> therefore could not <hi>plant, nor ſowe the doctrine of life,</hi> vntill the land was purged of the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſo foule enormities. Thus you ſee the very cauſe and reaſon why he begins with <hi>deſtruction, and rooting out:</hi> and afterward mentions <hi>planting, and building.</hi>

                  <p>Again, he ſpeaks <hi>of Kings, &amp; nations;</hi> becauſe howſoeuer <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was giuen and dedicated properly to his owne countrey; yet by accident (as they ſay) hee was alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Prophet to profane nations, as afterwards wee ſhall perceiue.

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:7696:19"/> that is to ſay, <hi>The doctrine which I haue committed (as it were) to his cuſtodie, hath ſuch power and efficacy in it, that it hath ſoueraigne authority ouer all mortall men, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one nation onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet we ſee, that albeit the malice and wickedneſſe of men conſtraine God to vſe ſeuerity and rigour; yet he neuer ſo forgets his nature, but he ſweetly allures ſuch as are not become altogether deſperate, to repentance; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hope of remiſſion of finnes, and ſaluation before them: and this courſe the doctrine of life alwayes holds. For howſoeuer it be the <hi>ſauour of death vnto death,</hi> to all ſuch as periſh: yet is it the <hi>ſauour of life vnto life,</hi> to the elect of God, 2. Cor. 2.15.16. I grant it will often fall out, that the greater part will conuert the doctrine of life and ſaluation to their owne ruine and perdition. But God notwithſtanding will neuer ſuffer all to periſh. Hee then, will cauſe his doctrine to be an incorruptible ſeed of life to his choſen: and afterwards he will <hi>build them vp</hi> into an holy Temple to himſelfe. This truth wee muſt hold. And thus the doctrine of God ought not to bee odious vnto vs, though it turne to the ruine of many. Why ſo? Becauſe it brings ſaluation alwaies to the elect: for it ſo plants them, that they <hi>take roote</hi> in the hope of euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleſſedneſſe; and after, it makes them holy Temples, conſecrated vnto God. Now it followes.</p>

                  <p>GOd in this place confirmes that which hee ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as touching the power of his word. Theſe two verſes then muſt be taken heere, as an expoſition of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7696:20"/> former: for he teacheth no new thing heere, but onely confirmes the former ſentence; namely, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets neither ſpeake in vaine, nor fruitleſly, in regard they are furniſhed with a celeſtiall power: as on the one ſide to build and plant; ſo on the other ſide, to deſtroy and plucke vp, as we haue alleaged the text out of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 2.15.16. where the true Teachers are armed with the ſame power. As alſo in the other place: We haue (ſaith he) vengeance ready againſt all vnbeleeuers,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.5.6.</note> though they burſt with pride; though by their loftineſſe they fray and ſcare all the world, yet haue wee the ſword of the ſpirit ready drawne in our hands, to put them to flight, in regard the word of God hath in it ſelfe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent efficacy, to ouerthrow and bring to nought all rebels. God then continues on this ſentence, when he ſaith, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah what ſeeſt thou?</hi> God had preſented before him <hi>a ſtaffe,</hi> or a rod of an Almond tree (as ſome tranſlate it) and the word indeed ſignifies ſo much; but in regard it comes of a verbe which ſignifies To watch, or To haſten, wee cannot properly tranſlate it heere an Almond tree. And yet I denie not but the Hebrew word ſignifies ſo much: though (as I haue ſaid) the word which ſignifies an Almond tree, comes of the verbe which ſignifies To watch; and they thinke that this tree is ſo called, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it brings forth fruit ſooner than all other trees. For the Almond trees flouriſh (as it is well enough knowne) euen in winter, and in the middeſt of the greateſt froſts. If we ſay then, I ſaw <hi>a rod,</hi> or a ſtaffe of <hi>an Almond tree,</hi> and that God anſweres, <hi>Thou haſt ſeene aright, becauſe I watch;</hi> then there will be no likeneſſe in the words, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will there be that grace of ſpeech: beſides, the ſence alſo will be vnapt. Of neceſſity therefore wee muſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate thus: Vnleſſe we will corrupt the text, and wrap vp the Prophets meaning in ambiguities. <hi>I ſee a rod,</hi> or a ſtaffe, of a watchman. Put the caſe that an Almond tree were heere noted; yet muſt the tree properly bee called <hi>watching,</hi> if we reſpect the etymologie of the word: and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7696:20"/> the thing it ſelfe alſo requires it, as all may now well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. God then ſets this kind before his ſeruant, namely, that he ſaw a ſtaffe watching. But wherefore? <hi>Thou hast</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeene the ſtaffe of watching aright, becauſe I watch vpon my word, that I may execute,</hi> or accompliſh it.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes the expoſitors reſtraine theſe words amiſſe, to puniſhments, as wee ſhall ſee anon. For thus they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, that the threatnings which the prophet will vſe afterwards, ſhould not bee without their effect, becauſe God is alwaies preſt to ſend whatſoeuer he hath denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But (as I thinke) this is to ſhut vp the ſence of this text, into too narrow a roome. For I make no doubt but God doth here in generall, magnifie his word, and ſets forth the ſame in regard of the efficacy thereof. As if hee ſhould ſay, I ſpeake not to my ſeruants, as if all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhould vaniſh into ſmoke, or that it ſhould fall to the ground; but that the efficacy thereof may forthwith be annexed: as it is ſaid in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 55.11.</note> 
                     <hi>My word ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto me void, but it ſhall proſper in euery thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſend it:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>I will cauſe the execution to goe hand in hand with the propheticall doctrine, that all the world may know I ſpeake not in vaine: alſo, that in my word there is not an empty ſound, which incontinently paſſeth away into the ayre; but a ſolide and certaine efficacy, which ſhall appeare in time conuenient.</hi> This is the cauſe why I ſaid that theſe two verſes muſt bee ioyned to the former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, where the Lord ſaid, that hee ſent his Prophet <hi>to plucke vp, to plant, to deſtroy, and to build.</hi> Hee prooues it then by other words; to wit, becauſe <hi>he watched vpon his word,</hi> to execute whatſoeuer he hath pronounced by the mouth of his ſeruants: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>It is true that I giue this commandement to my Prophets, that they ſpeake; but in regard they ſpeake from my mouth, I am (ſaith hee) ready to effect and accompliſh whatſoeuer I haue enioyned them.</hi> In a word, God heere ſignifies, that the might and power of his hand, goes with his word, whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are the Miniſters in reſpect of men. Thus it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7696:21"/> doctrine, belonging not onely to the puniſhments, but alſo to the promiſes. <hi>Thou haſt</hi> then (ſaith hee) <hi>ſeene aright, becauſe I watch.</hi> You ſee then, that God reſignes not his office vp to <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heere, although hee vſeth his labours in teaching: but he ſhewes that the power to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and accompliſh whatſoeuer the Prophet ſhould ſpeake, remained entirely in himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>We are alſo to obſerue that which he addes, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my word to accompliſh it.</hi> For God attributes nothing to <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> that was proper or peculiar to himſelfe; but he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifies the efficacie of his word: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>If thou remaine a faithfull ſeruant to me, I will neither diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt thee of thy hope, nor thoſe which ſhall obey thy doctrine: for I will accompliſh whatſoeuer either they or thou haſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</hi> Moreouer, whoſoeuer hath reſiſted thee, ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed. Why ſo? Becauſe I will bring their waies vpon their owne heads in due ſeaſon. To which purpoſe it is he vſeth the word <hi>To watch,</hi> or haſten; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewing,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.14.</note> that he is ready to put his word in execution in due time. I grant this appeares not ſo to vs alwaies; and therefore it is ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, If the prophecie tary, wait,, becauſe it will come, and will not tary,</hi> Habak. 2.3. <hi>God commands</hi> then, that we patiently waite for the accompliſhment of his word: but in the next place he addes (as it were) by way of correction, that <hi>it will come:</hi> that is to ſay, I will performe, and indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh whatſoeuer my Prophets haue ſpoken by my commandement. And thus there ſhall be no foreſlowing of it; becauſe the fit ſeaſon for the execution, depends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will of God, and not vpon mans iudgement. The reſt ſhould be handled now; but becauſe I ſee the time is paſt, I can paſſe no further at this time.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſumme.</note>Now the ſumme is, that the Caldeans were comming to deſtroy the City of Ieruſalem; to take away and aboliſh the dignity both of the kingdome, and of the Prieſthood. This was foretold and threatned before, as well by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as others of the Prophets: but all the prophecies were contemned: for whileſt <hi>Iſaiah</hi> liued, the King of Babell endeauoured to curry-fauour with King <hi>Hezekias:</hi> and the Iewes imagined, that ſuch a ſuccour came in good ſeaſon, to aide them againſt the Aſſyrians: but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not that the hearts of Kings are gouerned by the hand of God, and turned which way it pleaſeth him: neither did they once dreame, that long agoe, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres together, they had (by their ſinnes) prouoked Gods wrath againſt them, and that hee was become their enemie. For as much then, as all his threatnings had been deſpiſed, and (in a manner) derided; <hi>Ieremiah</hi> now comes (as it were) betweene, and ſaith, <hi>that the Northren people ſhall come;</hi> to wit, as well the Aſſyrians, as the Caldeans. For we know, that one of the Monarchies deuoured the other, in regard the Caldeans domineered ouer the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: and thus it came to paſſe, that almoſt all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Eaſt, the Medes and Perſians excepted; were ſubiected vnder their dominion. Now they were <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> in reſpect of Iudeah. Therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>he ſaw a ſeething pot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many by this pot, vnderſtand the King of Babylon: but it ſeemes they miſtake the Prophets meaning: and I could eaſily refell their expoſition, but that I content my ſelfe with the naked and bare truth, which we ſhall better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the progreſſe. <hi>This boyling pot</hi> then, is euen the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7696:22"/> nation of the Iewes; as will plainly appeare in the owne place. For my purpoſe is not now to heape vp all that may be ſaid, on either part. But the people are compared <hi>to a ſeething pot,</hi> in regard the Lord had boyled them, till they were (in a manner) conſumed to nothing. Now it is ſaid, <hi>that part of the pot looked towards the ſide of the North;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thence the fier was kindled; as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> by and by expounds it: and the ſimilitude agrees very aptly. For when a pot is ſet on the fier, it boyles on that ſide which is neareſt the flame, and all the bublings paſſe ouer to the other ſide. It is ſaid then that <hi>the pot ſeethed,</hi> or boyled; but ſo, <hi>that the mouth was towards the North.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe there was the <hi>fier;</hi> and there was the <hi>bellowes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. To be ſhort, God meant to ſhew to his Prophet, that the people were like to fleſh, which being put into the pot, ſeetheth, and after burnes, or (in proceſſe of time) conſumes away to nothing. The Prophet ſaw that the mouth of a ſeething pot, or, the face thereof, [that is, from the ſide on which it boyled] looked towards the North: and therefore it is that the Lord anſweres (who is the beſt expoſitor of this viſion) that he had preſented to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, <hi>the plague comming from the ſide of the North, vpon all the inhabitants of the land:</hi> namely, vpon Iudeah.</p>
                  <p>In which words God proteſts, that hee had already kindled the fier amongſt the Caldeans, and Aſſyrians; by which hee will ſeeth his people as fleſh, and in the end will bring them to nothing: as it ordinarily falles out, when the fleſh continues long in the pot: for if the fier be kindled, and maintained, and be ſtill blowed; of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the fleſh muſt vtterly waſt away, after it hath been thus ſod, or boyled. So in like manner God teſtifies, that the fier is euen now kindled in Caldea, and in Aſſyria: which ſhall not onely ſeeth the Iewes, but alſo vtterly conſume them.</p>
                  <p>But hee expreſſeth the ſame thing in other words, namely, <hi>that the plague ſhall come from the North,</hi>

I grant this is but a part of it, as we haue ſaid: For indeed, God minded to prouide for his elect; and thus aſtoniſhed them, onely to tame, and not to deſtroy them. And yet this is but the one halfe of the propheſie; to wit, that they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to expect any grace or fauour, in regard the Iewes had too much prouoked the Lord by their obſtinacie; and had ſo abuſed his patience, that their impiety was no way ſupportable. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then confirmes his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie againe more plainly, and poynts at that, as with the finger, which the other Prophets had foretold.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7696:23"/> thing ſo ſo euident and apparant; and becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not aright of his iudgements. The Prophet then hauing teſtified that the plague ſhould come from the North, addes now in the ſecond place, that it ſhall not come by chance; but that God himſelfe ſhall be the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and chiefe leader of the armie gathered by the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, who ſhould muſter their ſouldiers from all parts, and prepare an hoſt of men to deſtroy and root out the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet vſeth the word <hi>To cry; Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will cry to all the families of the North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee that God vſed ſundry and diuers manners of ſpeaking, when he meant to ſhew, that all nations are ſo vnder his power and command,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.26. and 7.18.</note> that hee raiſeth vp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ſouldiers as oft as it pleaſeth him. In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>Behold, I will hiſſe to the Egyptians:</hi> and compares them ſometimes to Bees. But all theſe formes of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tend to ſhew, that whileſt men bee tumultuous, and trouble all the world; that God on the other ſide orders and directs all things according to his ſoueraigne power; ſo as nothing falles out, but by his gouernment and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Wee ſee then, that our Prophet ſpeakes not like an hiſtoriographer, neither foretels hee ſimply what ſhould come to paſſe; but hee forthwith addes doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. This prophecie then, <hi>A plague ſhall come out of the North,</hi> had been bare and naked: but (as I haue already ſaid) hee now exerciſeth the office of a Teacher, that his prophecie might become profitable; in that he affirmes, God ſhall be the Generall, and chiefe Commander in this warre.</p>

                     <hi>Behold</hi> then, <hi>I will cry to all the families of the kingdomes of the North.</hi> I grant this was not at that time the onely Monarchie; but in regard the Iewes reſted ſo ſecurely vpon it, coupled with ſo great a careleſneſſe: they feared no calamity.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7696:24"/> then many kingdomes; which God cauſed violently and ſuddenly to come and ruſh vpon Iudeah: and it ſeemes alſo he hath reſpect to that vaine confidence, with which the Iewes deluded themſelues, thinking the Egyptians ſhould alwaies be ready to yeeld them ſuccour. Becauſe then, they were wont to oppoſe the Egyptians as a target or buckler; yea, as a mountaine or wall of braſſe. God derides their folly, in regard that whileſt they relied vpon the Egyptians, they thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſufficiently armed againſt <hi>all the forces</hi> of the Caldean Monarchy. This is the reaſon then, why in the firſt place he puts <hi>the families,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>the kingdome of the North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It followes; <hi>And they ſhall come, and ſet euery one his throne in the doores of the gates.</hi> Heere the Prophet ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that the Caldeans ſhall haue ſo great a power, that they ſhall dare to campe and pitch their tents euen before their gates: and not onely that, but <hi>they ſhall cloſe vp the wickets alſo.</hi> For he ſaith, <hi>the doores of the gates.</hi> And when he ſaith <hi>euery one,</hi> it is the rather to gaule the Iewes to the quicke: For they reſting vpon the ſuccours of Egypt, thought themſelues ſufficient enough to reſiſt; albeit the Caldeans were in a manner inuincible, after the Aſſyrians were vanquiſhed and ouercome. He ſaith then, that the armie ſhall not onely campe <hi>before the gates, but that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhall ſet his throne there;</hi> and ſhall erect it, as in a place of quietneſſe. In a word, God ſignifies that the Caldeans and Aſſyrians ſhall conquer, to rule; and <hi>to ſet their thrones</hi> euen in the fields, and before the gates of the City of Ieruſalem, as if it were in their owne houſes. Theſe things ſhall afterward be more fully explained, and many circumſtances alſo added to the ſame. But in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entrance, God meant to pronounce this ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iewes, that in good earneſt they might feele how their eſtate was gone.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>And vpon the walles thereof round about; and vpon all the Cities of Iudeah.</hi> Briefly, the Prophet heere threatens the ruine of the whole countrey: as if he ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7696:24"/> ſay, it is in vaine, for the Iewes truſt in their owne forces, and in the helpe of ſtrangers; for God will fight againſt them, becauſe the Chaldeans and Aſſyrians ſhall bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him: ſo as they ſhall ouercome, whatſoeuer the Iewes ſhall plot to the contrary.</p>

                  <p>GOd heere notes out the cauſe, why hee determined to puniſh the Iewes ſo ſeuerely. For it was needfull that as well the one as the other, ſhould bee manifeſted: as firſt, that the Chaldeans ſhould not breake in vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them by their owne inſtinct, but in regard they ſhould come vnder Gods pay, who will both muſter, and arme them. Marke that for one poynt. The ſecond was no leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> needfull to bee mentioned; namely, that God was not cruell, neither had he forgotten his couenant, whileſt hee purpoſed to reuenge himſelfe ſo ſharply; but that he dealt thus rigorouſly with them, in regard hee found the Iewes ſo rooted in their obſtinacy, that neceſſity vrged him thus to afflict and vtterly to conſume them. Why ſo? <hi>becauſe light puniſhments had profited them nothing at all.</hi> After the Lord had teſtified then, that he would be the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in this warre: hee therewithall ſhewes, what iuſt cauſes he hath, thus to chaſtize the Iewes. It cannot therefore be imputed vnto his cruelty, in regard they had formerly prouoked him by their ſuperſtitions, full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie. He ſaith then, <hi>I will ſpeake my iudgements with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many of the expoſitors referre this to the Chaldeans, and Aſſyrians; as if God commanded them, as chiefe Iudges are wont, to giue that in charge to their bailiffes and officers, which they haue once decreed to bee done and performed: but this expoſition ſutes not well:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7696:25"/> and beſides, the prophet himſelfe refutes it ſufficiently. For he conioynes this together, <hi>I will ſpeake my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with them, vpon their malice.</hi> But what is it <hi>to ſpeake,</hi> or pronounce <hi>iudgements?</hi> It is, when God cites the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked before his iudgement ſeate, and exerciſeth the office of a Iudge. And this language is vſuall throughought the Scriptures, as we ſhall ſee in the end of this booke; where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Chap. 52.9.</note> that the King of Babylon <hi>ſpake iudgements with King Zedekias:</hi> that is to ſay, he carried himſelfe towards him as a Iudge; as wee haue it in our ordinary ſpeech. Thus then, God now teſtifies, <hi>that he will bee the Iudge of his people:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Hitherto I haue been ſilent; not that the wicked among you are vnknowne vnto me, but it is becauſe I haue borne with thoſe poore wretches, to try if I might ſee any hope of repentance in them. But now (ſaith he) <hi>I will be a Iudge vnto them,</hi> in regard length of time hath manifeſted, that they were become vtterly incurable. here is an oppoſition then, betweene Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which hee had long vſed towards them (when though he might, yet notwithſtanding hee handled them not roughly, but deferred his vengeance) and this time of his vengeance which was now at hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will ſpeake my iudgements</hi> then, <hi>with the Iewes:</hi> that is, I will ſpeedily goe vp to my iudgement ſeat: hitherto I haue forborne to doe it, and haue waited to ſee whether they would returne to me or no: but ſeeing they repent not, and that I perceiue well enough they are become graceleſſe, and ſo peruerſe of nature, that they alwayes heape ſinne vpon ſinne, I will now begin to execute mine office; to wit, that of a <hi>Iudge.</hi> But (as I haue ſaid) wee muſt keepe in mind Gods intention in this place: for his meaning is, to diſcharge himſelfe of all blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches which men endeauour to lay vpon him; becauſe the worſer ſort of them are wont to repine at his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when he chaſtiſeth them. He ſets his iudgements then before their eyes; as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>You cannot charge me, neither can any obiect againſt me, that I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7696:25"/> my ſelfe ſeuerely, or cruelly; for my iudgements will be found iuſt, though I iudge you in rigour:</hi> and therefore hee addes, <hi>vpon all their malice,</hi> or wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he notes out one kind; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they haue burnt incenſe vnto ſtrange gods.</hi> No doubt the Iewes had many waies prouoked Gods vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but this one kinde is heere added, becauſe the firſt ſpring of all euill was, that they had forſaken the Law, together with Gods pure worſhip and ſeruice: yet he names the generall, <hi>in all their wickedneſſe.</hi> Neither is this clauſe <hi>vpon all their wickedneſſe,</hi> added without cauſe: For his meaning is, that they were not wicked in ſome one reſpect alone; but that they piled vp diuers ſinnes together, as vpon an heape: now immediatly after hee addes, <hi>becauſe they haue forſaken me:</hi> heere God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>their reuolt.</hi> For it may haply fall out (whereof wee haue daily experience) that a man may faile in ſome one thing, and another may bee tainted with this or that naturall vice and corruption; and thus (for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) euery one of vs may bee lyable to the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: but the Lord heere ſhewes how the Iewes were ſo corrupted, that nothing remained ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: therefore it is, that he puts <hi>all their malice;</hi> and afterward addes, <hi>their reuolt..</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They haue forſaken me:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>they haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denied me: I ſay not that one of them hath played the theefe, that another hath committed adultery, or, that the third hath ſinned in drunkenneſſe: but they are all become apoſtataes, all haue denied me, and haue broken their faith and loyalty:</hi> I haue been <hi>forſaken</hi> of them then, and they haue wholly eſtranged themſelues from me. We ſee now then, how the Prophet ſharpely aggrauates the <hi>wickednes</hi> of his nation: but in the end this is added as the paterne thereof; to wit, <hi>that they had burnt incenſe to ſtrange gods:</hi> that is, they had reuolted from the true God, to giue themſelues ouer to idolatry: to which he by and by adds, <hi>they bowed downe before the works of their hands.</hi> For as oft
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7696:26"/> as the Scripture vſeth theſe words, it ſignifies, that there is too too great a rage and madneſſe in men;<note place="margin">The reaſon why ſtockes and ſtones are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as God.</note> who not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſtead of God, worſhip the Sunne, the Moone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; but the very Idols which their owne fingers haue made. For whence comes it that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and Infidels, worſhip ſtocks and ſtones; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelues haue framed vnto them, noſes, hands, and eares.

Aske the reaſon: truly <hi>becauſe they haue made them eyes, eares, &amp;c. they then haue made gods.</hi> Therefore you now ſee the Prophets drift, when hee ſaith, <hi>that the Iewes worſhipped the workes of their owne hands.</hi> But I doe the rather paſſe ouer theſe things lightly now, becauſe it is a doctrine which ye ought to bee well exerciſed in.

                  <p>IN the firſt place God commands his Prophet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime this heauie and wofull iudgement, whereof wee haue formerly heard. For his meaning was not to ſpeake to <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in a corner, or in hugger-mugger to himſelfe alone; but he puts him in truſt with that which he meant ſhould bee publiſhed to the whole body of the people: that is the cauſe why hee addes, <hi>And thou.</hi> Wee ſee then that the Prophet was inſtructed and <hi>taught of God,</hi> that he might bee able boldly and feareleſly to publiſh that meſſage which hereafter hee will deliuer. Theſe things
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7696:26"/> therefore muſt bee read altogether; namely, that God will aſcend into his iudgement ſeat, to execute that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which hitherto hee hath deferred. Secondly, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will haue <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to be the preacher thereof, which hee is now about forthwith to execute. <hi>Thou then.</hi> This is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by way of a concluſion: for the word <hi>And,</hi> muſt bee thus reſolued: Thou therefore, that is, ſeeing thou haſt heard, that I will ſhortly bring my wrath and vengeance vpon this people for their wickedneſſe, and that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the time appointed is at hand: ſeeing alſo thou knoweſt that this hath been manifeſted vnto thee, that thou admoniſhing of them, they may bee ſo much the more left without excuſe: <hi>Thou then, truſſe vp thy loynes.</hi> Thus then wee ſee to what purpoſe God ſpeakes to his ſeruant <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> in this particular manner; namely, that in the preſence of the people, he might execute the office of a publike Teacher.</p>
                  <p>And hence we gather, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that whoſoeuer is called to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in the Church of God, hee cannot poſſibly bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from blame, vnleſſe hee freely and bouldly publiſh whatſoeuer the Lord hath giuen him in charge: and therefore it is, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that hee was pure and cleane from the blood of all men; becauſe hee had taught from houſe to houſe, and publiſhed that whole councell of God which he had receiued, Act. 20.26.27. And in another place he ſaith, <hi>Woe be vnto mee if I preach not the Goſpell, for this office is committed vnto me,</hi> 1. Cor. 9.16.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Lord bids the Prophet <hi>to truſſe vp his loynes,</hi> it muſt be referred vnto the garments which were then in vſe among them of the Eaſt; as they are alſo yet vnto this day, for they weare long garments: therefore as oft as they purpoſed to vndertake any buſineſſe, or iourney, they were wont to truſſe them vp about them. He ſaith then, <hi>truſſe vp your loynes;</hi> that is, enterpriſe and diſpatch this buſineſſe which I haue giuen thee in charge. In the meane while he willes him to take courage
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7696:27"/> and heart to him, that he may (without ſtop or ſtay) goe cheerfully and diligently about his calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſpeake vnto them all that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee.</hi> To be ſhort, in theſe words God ſignifies, that he is not purpoſed to doe his vtmoſt againſt them, till hee hath once more tried whether any hope of repentance be yet left or no. I grant he knew well enough that they were vtterly incurable: but his meaning was by this, the better to diſcouer or lay open their peruerſity and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, whileſt (in the laſt place) he commands the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to pronounce againſt them this laſt ſentence of condemnation.</p>
                  <p>He againe repeates that which he ſaid before, <hi>Be not afraid of their faces.</hi> And this exhortation was of great vſe: for <hi>Ieremiah</hi> tooke vpon him a very thankleſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in regard of men. Why ſo? Becauſe it was all one as if he had been an herald of armes, proclaiming open war againſt them, in the name of the Lord of hoſts. In as much then as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> brought an expreſſe meſſage touching the ruine of this people, becauſe their rebellion had been ſo great, that God teſtified hee would no more hereafter <hi>ſhew them any fauour:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 16.13.</note> this muſt needs bee an hard ſaying for them to heare: but eſpecially, if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the pride wherewith the Iewes were poſſeſſed. For they gloried in the holineſſe of their race and ſtocke: alſo, (as we ſhall ſee afterwards) the Temple (in their conceit) was an impugnable fortreſſe (as it were) euen againſt God himſelfe:<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> Being then growne thus obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, it was very requiſite he ſhould bee confirmed in his calling <hi>more than once,</hi> that he might (with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courage) ſet vpon his charge. This is the cauſe then why this exhortation is redoubled, <hi>Feare not their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place he addes, <hi>Leſt I make thee feare;</hi> or, leſt I tread thee vnder foot. The word ſignifies ſometime to feare, it ſignifies alſo, tread vpon. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> hath corrupted the Prophets meaning, when hee interprets, I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7696:27"/> will neuer make thee afraid. I deny not but this is a good and holy doctrine; namely, that God will furniſh his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet with ſuch force and power, that he ſhall remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible againſt the rage of his enemies: yea, it is moſt certaine that God ſhould in vaine exhort vs to quit our ſelues like men in this race, were it not that himſelfe did therewithall inwardly endow vs both with ſtrength and conſtancy, by his holy ſpirit: this (I ſay) is moſt true; but the word here vſed will not ſuffer vs ſo to expound this place. What meant the Lord to ſay then? (Be it that wee tranſlate, <hi>to tread vpon,</hi> or, <hi>I will cauſe thee to feare</hi>) the ſence will ſute very well. For as ſoone as God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his Prophet to bee valiant, and of an inuincible courage: he now addes, <hi>Take heed;</hi> for if thou quaileſt, I will make thee feare with a witneſſe; or, I will indeed trample thee to peeces vnder my feet, before their faces. His meaning then in theſe words is, that the Prophet ſhal be ſufficiently furniſhed, if hee acknowledge himſelfe to bee ſent of God: and if in conſideration thereof, hee carry himſelfe according to that ſoueraigne authority which is put into his hands, not fearing the faces of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, heere is a ſecret threat included, thus, <hi>looke to it;</hi> if thou behaueſt thy ſelfe valiantly, I will bee with thee: and albeit at the firſt encounter, thoſe that oppoſe againſt thee, haue the faces of Beares, and Lions; yet ſhall they gaine nothing by it in the end. But if thou prooue a milkeſop, or a white-liuered ſouldier, I will put thee to ſhame; that is to ſay, thou ſhalt not onely bee timorous and fearfull, but I will alſo cauſe thee to bee deſpiſed of all: or, euery one ſhall be ready to offer thee foule indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, in regard thou haſt made thy ſelfe vnworthy that I ſhould ſtand for thee, or giue thee ſtrength and power to put thine enemies to flight. We ſee then whereunto theſe words tend, <hi>Feare not, leſt I make thee feare;</hi> that is to ſay, be of good courage, leſt worthily thou be put to ſhame, and leſt thou feare them, according as thou well deſerueſt:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7696:28"/> yea, not onely that, but, leſt they bruiſe and breake thee; yea, leſt peraduenture they preſume to tread thee vnder their feet; becauſe thou (to whom I haue giuen the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of my ſpirit) ſhalt thereby vtterly diſable thy ſelfe.</p>

For this cauſe God now teſtifies, that he ſhall be <hi>as a City well fortified, and as an iron pillar:</hi> albeit the word <hi>ſtay, and bearing vp,</hi> will be apt, and will alſo agree well enough, in regard it comes of another root, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, to beare vp, or ſtay: as alſo, becauſe according to this ſence the Prophet meanes, hee ſhall bee a pillar, not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7696:29"/> onely to be ſet vp in ſome void place, but which ſhall beare vp the wall or building. The ſence is cleere enough: for the Lord ſignifies, that his ſeruant ſhall be inuincible; ſo as whatſoeuer his enemies deuiſed or plotted to the contrary, yet they ſhould neuer preuaile againſt him: as it is in the next verſe.</p>

What then? There was ſome other conſideration which moued him not vtterly to reiect them, that is, hee waited to ſee whether they were become wholly incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as touching their wickedneſſe or no. Thus hee begins then: <hi>I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred thee with the kindnes,</hi> or, for the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>of thy youth, and with the loue of thy eſpouſals.</hi> By theſe words he ſignifies, that he did not much regard what the Iewes deſerued at his hands: nay, he profeſſeth, that hee ſaw no worthineſſe at all in them, which might prouoke him in any ſort to care for them, or to labour their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion by the miniſtery of his Prophet: but what hee did, <hi>was in reſpect of his former benefits beſtowed vpon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some tranſlate, I called to mind the piety or mercy of thy youth; and this word <hi>Lak,</hi> that is, <hi>thee,</hi> may bee ſo reſolued, as in many other places. Others omit this word
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7696:31"/> 
                     <hi>Lak:</hi> ſome adde a copulatiue, And I haue remembred thee, and thy mercy. But none of theſe (as I thinke) haue attained the Prophets meaning: although to ſay the truth, there is no obſcurity in the words, if we heere onely ſupply a particle, to wit, that God remembred his people, in reſpect of that mercy and compaſſion which hee had on them, and for that loues ſake which he bare vnto them from the beginning. This (as I take it) is the Prophets true and naturall meaning; namely, that God heere takes away from the Iewes all matter of pride and boaſting: as if he ſhould ſay, They deſerue not that I ſhould ſo much as looke towards them; onely my meaning is, to ſhew my ſelfe a father to them; not for their ſakes, but that the benefits which I haue heretofore beſtowed vpon them may not vaniſh away. In a word, he here renders a reaſon wherfore he now ſends <hi>Ieremiah</hi> after the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets whom he had ſent before: as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>I thinke this may ſerue as a ſufficient teſtimony to confirme you in the aſſurance of that fatherly care &amp; reſpect I haue of you, in that I here ſend you another of my Prophets, to offer you hope of pardon; if you will come home into the right way, and ſeeke reconciliation with me. But if you would know the cauſe why I thus remember you: whence is it, I pray you, ſeeing you haue forgotten me, and cast my Law altogether behind your backes? Euen becauſe I meane yet to continue on my bounty towards you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He names <hi>the mercy of youth</hi> in the paſſiue ſignification. For by theſe words his meaning is not, <hi>that the Iewes were in times paſt mercifull, but that they had taſted of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them:</hi> yet the ſimilitude which he vſeth is worth the obſeruing. For God here compares himſelf <hi>to a yong bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, that hath married a faire young damſell in the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of her youth:</hi> which ſimilitude is very frequent among the Prophets. But I meane not to trauell any further in the expoſition of the words now, becauſe wee ſhall haue occaſion to handle them more fully in another place. In as much then as God had married the people of Iſraell,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7696:32"/> by redeeming of them, and in bringing them out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; that is the reaſon why he ſaith, hee remembred the people, <hi>in reſpect of ſuch a mercy, and of ſuch a loue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He puts <hi>mercy,</hi> or liberality, before <hi>loue.</hi> For the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word ſignifies, that free fauour, courteſie, or libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which is ſhewed to them which are in miſery. By this word <hi>loue,</hi> God alſo in many places of the Scriptures ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that free choyce, by which hee had receiued the whole body of this people. But the proper ſignification is here more cleerly expreſſed, when <hi>mercy,</hi> or free fauour is put in the firſt place, and that this <hi>loue</hi> followes after. I grant hee addes nothing new to the former: but onely the Prophet in more plaine termes ſhewes, <hi>that this people was loued of God, for none other cauſe, but in reſpect of his mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere is a text then very remarkable: for God teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that his couenant ſhal continue ſtable and inuiolable, notwithſtanding the Iewes had perfidiouſly violated it. For howſoeuer all thoſe that deſcended of <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, were not true and legitimate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the promiſe: yet God ceaſed not to continue true, as on his behalfe, ſo as his gifts and calling were without repepentance, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, in Rom. 11.29. From theſe words of the Prophet, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> learne wee then, that God contented not himſelfe with ſending one prophet alone, but continued on this fauour ſtill, becauſe hee would not haue his couenant become fruitleſſe. True it is, the Iewes had wickedly broken the couenant; and the multitude alſo for their parts went the high way to hell and deſtruction, and were therefore vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cut off, as they well deſerued: yet would God giue manifeſt teſtimonies, that his grace depended not vpon mens inconſtancy: as alſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in another place; namely, that though all men ſhould prooue lyars, and diſloyall, yet will not God therefore become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, but will remaine ſtedfaſt in his couenant, Rom. 3.4. This is it which we gather from the Prophets words,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7696:32"/> when in the beginning he ſaith, <hi>God remembred his people in regard of the mercy of their youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas hee ſpeakes of <hi>youth,</hi> and of the eſpouſals: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> hence we gather, that God preuented this people of his free liberality. For what acquaintance or familiarity had they with God, but only in regard it pleaſed him to make choyce of them. Certainly theſe eſpouſals had neuer been begun as on the peoples behalfe, vnleſſe God had preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by his grace. What was <hi>Abraham?</hi> What were all his poſterity? God therefore heere ſignifies, that the fountaine of all theſe benefits proceeded hence, that he vouchſafed to chuſe the people as peculiar to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Which he yet better confirmes in the reſt of the words ſaying, <hi>when thou followedſt me in the deſart, in a land that was not ſowne.</hi> Wee know the people behaued not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo obediently to God as was meete, no not after their redemption. It cannot be affirmed heere then, that God any way magnifies their deſarts, but (as I haue ſaid) he confirmes his former ſpeech; namely, <hi>that hee could not cast off his care of them, whom hee had once adopted for his owne: whom alſo hee had drawne into the wilderneſſe after him, as ſeparating them thereby from all the reſt of the world beſides:</hi> and yet by way of yeelding them ſo much, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he attributes this ſeruice which the people did him, <hi>in following him through ſuch craggie pathes, to their praiſe and commendation: as if a young damſell refuſing no labour nor trauell, ſhould for the loue ſhe beares to her husband, follow him through thicke and thin.</hi> In the next words to theſe, he addes:</p>

Secondly, he ſhewes how vnworthily the people behaued themſelues, whileſt they ſhould haue acknowledged ſo many benefits receiued: and therefore when he ſaith, <hi>that Iſrael was holy,</hi> hee ſpeakes not ſo, to honour them.

See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God then in the Law, had commanded the firſt fruits to be offered vnto him, and afterwards to be giuen to the Prieſts, for this cauſe alluding to the ordinary cuſtome, <hi>he calles the people of Iſraell the firſt of his fruits.</hi> For the nations which were ſcattered heere and there, were not exempt from vnder his dominion (in regard hee is the Creator of the whole world; and beſides, hath alwaies manifeſted himſelfe to be the foſter Father thereof) but hee paſſed by all other nations, to chuſe and reſerue to himſelfe the ſtocke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> vpon condition to be the guardian therof, by his power and aſſiſtance. Seeing God then, by theſe fauours, had in this ſort obliged this people particularly to himſelfe; with what a ſtrait and <hi>ſacred bond,</hi> ought they for their parts to haue been obliged and bound vnto him? Their diſloyalty therefore was ſo much the greater, and the more odious, in that they light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7696:33"/> eſteemed ſuch rare and vndeſerued fauours, as God had ſhewed them. We ſee now then wherefore it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>that the people of Iſraell were hallowed to the Lord, and were the first of his fruits:</hi> but withall he giues them to vnderſtand, that a time will come wherein God will alſo gather other nations into his Church. For the Iewes dedicated and offered vnto God, the reuenue of the whole yeere, by the firſt fruits. Thus Iſraell <hi>was like to the first fruits:</hi> in regard God afterwards alſo receiued ſtrangers: who for a long time had been held and reputed for profane and vnholy. But the Prophets chiefe drift notwithſtanding is to ſhew how great the people, fault was, in not acknowledging the benefits and priuiledges which they had receiued of God.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he addes, <hi>whoſoeuer ſhall eate thereof, ſhall be liable to puniſhment.</hi> I told you before, that this ſenſe likes me beſt, becauſe the expoſition by and by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>euil ſhal come vpon them.</hi> And thus the meaning is, <hi>that ſuch ſhall not onely be guilty before God, that ſhall eate of his firſt fruits, as hauing offended: but hee referres this to the puniſhment:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>If the profane nations preſume to eate of theſe my first fruits, which are conſecrated vnto me; they ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed.</hi> For whoſoeuer durſt bee ſo bold raſhly to ſeaze vpon thoſe firſt fruites which were once dedicated vnto God; God puniſhed ſuch an one as a ſacrilegious theefe. But if any had, rather vnderſtand it otherwiſe; namely, that it was not lawfull to offend Iſraell, or to offer him any violence, becauſe hee was vnder Gods protection, I will not greatly gainſay it. Yet the phraſe of this tongue leades vs notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to follow the other expoſition; to wit, that ſuch as ſhall offend Iſraell, ſhall not onely be guilty; but (which is more) they cannot eſcape Gods correcting and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing hand. Why ſo? For, <hi>euill ſhall fall vpon them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> In the verſes following, hee will touch the vſe of this doctrine more at large.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet proſecutes the ſame poynt of doctrine ſtill: for God heere blames the people for no ſmall fault, <hi>ſeeing they had forgotten his benefits:</hi> and yet had he redeemed them after ſuch an admirable manner, that it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7696:35"/> worthily deſerued to be celebrated, not of one nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of all the nations of the world beſides. See then how iuſtly he taxeth the Iewes for their hatefull ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for forgetting the memory of ſo famous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable a deliuerance. Had they not at all felt Gods bounty and liberality towards them; nay, or rather, had they had but ſome little ſemblance thereof, then their fault peraduenture might haue been ſomewhat the more excuſable: but God hauing not after an ordinary manner diſcouered his power from heauen, and hauing openly manifeſted his maieſty and glory, euen in the very eye of the people; what a barbarity was it in them after all theſe things, to forget God who had ſo plainly declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to them by ſuch notable experiments? Thus we haue the Prophets meaning then, when he ſaith, <hi>they ſaid not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See chap. 5.24.</note> For God heere taxeth the ſloth of the Iewes, for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in themſelues how they were perpetually bound with ſtrict bands to the maieſty of God for thoſe great fauours he had ſhewed them in deliuering them ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly out of the land of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When he ſaith,</hi> they ſaid not, <hi>where is the Lord?</hi> Hee giues them to vnderſtand, that hee was alwayes preſent before them, or nigh vnto them: but they were blind, and therefore had no pretext for their ignorance: for they needed not to haue ſought him farre off, nor haue fetched many long circuits about. Had they onely then but thought thus with themſelues, <hi>Hath not God once redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs?</hi> had they (I ſay) but thought thus in themſelues, they would neuer haue <hi>followed their vanities.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> Whence proceeded ſuch a fault then, or rather ſuch a frenſie, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Idols? Euen from this, <hi>They would not vouchſafe to apply their minds and hearts to ſeeke after the Lord.</hi> Thus then the Prophet here preuents the replies of hypocrites, who would be ready to alleage that they were deceiued, and that they faulted rather of ignorance, than otherwiſe. For it is alwayes the manner of thoſe that are found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſeeke euaſions and ſtarting holes, as ſoone as they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7696:36"/> be called to an account. That the Iewes then might not be able to bring in their excuſes, the Prophet telles them heere in plaine words, that they erred not of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but of malice, through which they were carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after their vanities and lies; in regard they had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly deſpiſed the Lord, and would not ſo much <hi>as aske after him,</hi> though he was neare enough vnto them.</p>
                  <p>This place is worthy to be noted: for nothing is more vſuall with the wicked, after they be once conuinced, than to ſeeke this refuge; namely, that the giuing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to all ſuperſtitions, proceeds forſooth, from their good intentions. The Prophet therefore meets with this wile, and ſhewes, that where the knowledge of God hath been once entertained among men, there his name and glory cannot be blotted out, vnleſſe it be of ſet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, when they wittingly and willingly eſtrange them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from him. And thus this one clauſe ſo condemnes all Apoſtataes, that they haue nothing to anſwere, when they obiect, We were ouertaken through ignorance. For a man ſhall no ſooner bring them forth to the triall, but their malice and ingratitude ſhall forthwith be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in regard they vouchſafed not to aske, <hi>Where is the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He by and by addes that which is the expoſition of this ſentence. For I told you, that the queſtion is not here of ſentencing babes in vnderſtanding, but of the Iewes; who by ſure and certaine proofes knew that God was their Father. Seeing then, God had manifeſted himſelfe vnto them by ſo many infallible teſtimonies, they had not to alleage for themſelues ſo much as any ſhew of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That is the cauſe then why the Prophet ſaith, <hi>It came not into their thoughts to aske; Where is the Lord, that hath brought vs out of the land of Egypt? &amp;c.</hi> This could not be ſaid generally of all nations; therefore I told you before, that this ſpeech is directed particularly to the Iewes, who had taſted and felt the power of God by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonies; ſo as they could not offend, but of ſet
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7696:36"/> purpoſe, that is, in quenching (by their frowardneſſe) the cleare light that ſhined before them. Alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet yet further aggrauates their offence, by certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: for hee ſaith not onely that they were brought out of Egypt, but that God was alwaies to them in ſtead of a Captaine <hi>and leader,</hi> and that for fortie yeeres together: for vnder this word <hi>deſart,</hi> he notes the time. Now becauſe the hiſtory thereof was freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; that is the cauſe why hee thinkes it enough to touch it onely in a word. And yet euen therein he nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſets forth Gods glory, in mentioning <hi>the deſart.</hi> But in the firſt place obſerue, that the Iewes were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, in that they remembred not how their fathers had been miraculouſly preſerued for the ſpace of fortie yeeres, by Gods immediate hand, and not after an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner. For they had no bread to nouriſh them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they water: God cauſed water to flow out of the rocke, and afterwards hee filled them with bread, which fell from heauen: neither did their garments waxe old by length of time. Wee ſee then, that their fault is heere augmented by the circumſtance of time: now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the things which I ſpake of. For the Prophet calles the deſart, a <hi>dry,</hi> or vaſt <hi>land, a terrible land, an hidious,</hi> or horrible <hi>land, a land of deadly darknes.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>you were preſerued in the middest of many deathes: for none euer paſſed through this land, neither did any</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>euer inhabite there.</hi> Whence appeared your ſafety then, or from what fountaine? Truly euen from death it ſelfe, ſaith he. For, as for the deſart, what was it but an hideous ſpectacle, in which you might from all parts bee viewed, to bee not onely compaſſed about with one, but with an hundred deaths? Seeing God then (beyond the order of nature) brought you by a ſtretched out arme, from out of Egypt, and ſuſtained you forty yeres long in the deſart: what ſhew or colour of reaſon haue you to excuſe ſuch a folly, or rather madneſſe, that are now ſo farre eſtranged from me?</p>

                  <p>He goes on in the next words, <hi>And I haue cauſed you to enter. Ieremiah</hi> brings in God himſelfe ſpeaking here; namely, how he ſtretched forth his hand (as it were) to this poore of-ſpring of <hi>Abraham;</hi> that hee might put them in poſſeſſion of the land of promiſe: for as it is ſaid in the 44.<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.3.</note> Pſalme, It was neither by their arme nor ſword that they obtained this poſſeſſion: for albeit they had to fight indeed againſt many enemies; yet in all their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails notwithſtanding, the victory came of the Lord. And thus he might truly and rightly affirme, that they entred no otherwiſe into this land, than by his conduct and leading: to wit, in opening a way and paſſage vnto them, and in ouercomming and deſtroying their enemies, that they might enter into, and enioy the land which hee had promiſed them. <hi>I haue brought you</hi> then (ſaith hee) <hi>into the land of Hacarmel.</hi> Some take this to bee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of the place: and certainly mount Carmel is ſo called, in reſpect of the great fruitfulneſſe thereof. For as much then as this mountaine tooke its name in reſpect of the richneſſe of the ſoyle; what maruell is it, if <hi>Ieremiah</hi> compares the land of Iſrael <hi>to mount Carmel?</hi> Others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, as if the particle, which imports a ſimilitude, ſhould be heere vnderſtood; I haue cauſed you to enter into a land <hi>which is like</hi> to Carmel: but what neede wee offer violence to the Prophets words. I thinke then, that the noune is a noune appellatiue, ſignifying fruitfulneſſe; namely, <hi>that the Iſraelites were conducted by the hand of God, into a plentifull and fruitfull land:</hi> of the fruitfulneſſe whereof, mention is often made, as well in the Law, as in the Prophets.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:7696:37"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To eate his fruit and his abundance:</hi> that is to ſay, The end why I brought you in thither, was to enioy the great abundance, and large reuenue thereof. God by theſe words then meant to make it knowne to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that it was their duties to haue been prouoked by ſuch benefits, to ſerue him in vprightneſſe; in regard he had ſought by ſuch ientleneſſe to draw them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and had vſed them after ſo gracious a manner. But ſo much the more as God had ſhewed himſelfe liberall towards them, ſo much the leſſe inſupportable was their vnworthy reuolt in forſaking God; and in contemning ſuch abundance and variety of all good things. For which cauſe he addes afterwards: <hi>And you polluted my land, and haue made mine heritage an abomination:</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>This is the recompence and the reward that I reaped from my bounty I vſed towards you. Indeed I gaue you this land; but vpon condition, that you ſhould ſerue mee in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe therin: but you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue polluted it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he calles it <hi>his land,</hi> or heritage:<note place="margin">God ſo giues vs leaue ſo to vſe his benefits, that ſtill he reſerues the right and title of them to himſelfe.</note> as if hee ſhould ſay, I ſo gaue you this land, that in the meane while I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meant to ſhut my ſelfe out of that right and intereſt which I haue in it; howſoeuer I was content you ſhould reape the whole commodity of it. He ſhewes then, that they had wickedly abuſed his bounty, <hi>in polluting this land, notwithſtanding it was dedicated to his name and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> He calles it <hi>his heritage,</hi> in the ſame ſence: as if hee ſhould ſay, You haue in ſuch wiſe poſſeſſed this land by right of inheritance, <hi>that yet the heritage came to you, from me your heauenly father.</hi> They were to conſider then, that they therefore entred into this land, <hi>becauſe it was giuen for an heritage to Abraham and his children.</hi> But by whoſe gift? <hi>Was not God the author of it?

                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith afterwards, <hi>thoſe which kept the Low.</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word ſignifies, to hold, and comprehend: it alſo ſignifies ſometimes, to runne. And thus it may admit two expoſitions in this place: either that the Prieſts held; that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is to ſay, vnderſtood the Law; or rather, that they had it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in their cuſtody: neither will it ſute well to ſay, that they ſuppreſſed, or kept the Law hidden, in regard the Lord ſpeakes heere <hi>to them first,</hi> by way of conceſſion or yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much vnto them: but afterwards hee alſo ſhewes, euen by this, that they were ſo much the more wicked, in that they became vtterly careleſſe of their duties. He ſaith then, <hi>Thoſe which had the cuſtodie of the Law:</hi> not that hee meant they kept the Law of God in truth, nor as if they kept it by them of any pure zeale; but onely in regard of an outward profeſſion of it. For they would needs bee held the keepers of the Law, as hauing the heauenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof cloſed vp within their breaſt, like vnto an hidden treaſure;<note place="margin">Hag. 2.12. Mal. 2.7.</note> in regard <hi>the people were to ſeeke counſell at their lips, as being the organs and inſtruments of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thus then, for as much as they bragged of the knowledge of the Law, and that they were the keepers of it: therfore the Prophet bitterly inuayes againſt them, becauſe <hi>they</hi> knew not God. And it ſeemes that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> drawes that which hee ſaith in Rom. 2.20.21.22. from this place, Thou which vnderſtandeſt the forme of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7696:39"/> the Law, Thou that preacheſt another ſhould not commit adultery, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteſt thou adultery? condemneſt thou Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, &amp; yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteſt thou ſacriledge? For thou obſerueſt the law, thou approueſt it, thou glorieſt in God; thou haſt knowledge and vnderſtanding. In which words S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcouers the wickedneſſe of hypocrites; for they are the more worthy to be deteſted, by how much the more they are ſwollen with pride and vaine-glory; and yet in the meane while profane the ſacred name of God, whileſt they thus brag; we are preachers and teachers of it, and are (as it were) his Prophets. We ſee now that this which he puts heere in the ſecond place, belongs chiefly to the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> who are therefore called the guardians of the Law, becauſe it was committed vnto them by right of their ordination,<note place="margin">Hag. 2.12.</note> as we may gather out of Mal. 2.7.</p>
                  <p>By way of conſequence he addes, <hi>that the Paſtors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themſelues perfidiouſty, or diſloyally towards God.</hi> This may be referred as well to the Kings Councell, as generally to all the Gouernours of Cities. And for my part, I nothing doubt, but the Prophet meant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all ſuch as had any charge of gouernment ouer the people of God. For Kings, and their Counſellors, as alſo the Prophets, are vſually ſtiled by this title of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith moreouer, <hi>That the Prophets prophecied in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> The name of a Prophet in it ſelfe is a ſacred title: but <hi>Ieremiah</hi> (according to a common errour) calles them ſo in this place, who were nought elſe indeed, but meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers and couſeners of the people. For God had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them of all light of true knowledge. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becauſe they ſtill retained a reputation among the people, as if they had been true Prophets: therefore <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſtickes not to grant them this title; as well in regard of their duty, as of their vocation and calling. Euen as we at this day call them Biſhops, Prelats, Primats, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who brag much of performing the duty and office of Paſtors in the Papacie; howſoeuer we know ſome of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7696:39"/> them are wolues, and others of them dumbe dogs; yet we yeeld them theſe titles, wherein they glory, becauſe they deſerue double condemnation for vſurping wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and with an intolerable pride full of ſacriledge) theſe ſacred titles; and for diſpoyling the Lord of that honour which by good right appertaines vnto him. So <hi>Ieremiah</hi> now whiles he calles them <hi>Prophets,</hi> meanes thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors who then wickedly ſeduced the people.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>they prophecied in</hi> or by <hi>Baal,</hi> that is to ſay, they reuerenced idols more than the true God. We know this name of <hi>Baal</hi> went then for currant in euery ones mouth. The Prophets ſometimes call all ſorts of idols <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alims</hi> in the plurall number. But becauſe <hi>Baal</hi> ſignifies a Patron; as oft as the Prophets mention either <hi>Baal</hi> in the ſingular number, or <hi>Baalims</hi> in the plurall; they meane thereby all thoſe petty gods whom the Iewes had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together: as if God, not content with his ſole and onely power, needed ſome fellow-helpers to bee ioyned with him, as in the Papacy; where, at this day, they ſticke not to confeſſe that there is one ſoueraigne Maieſty; but in the meane while they make none account of him, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther attribute they any more to him, than they doe to their ſtockes and ſtones which they forge at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The ſame vice raigned then among the Iewes, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pagans. For both confeſſed freely and ſimply that there was but one ſoueraigne power; yet had they an infinite troupe of dunghill gods, who were ſo many <hi>Baalims.</hi> Therefore when the Prophet ſaith heere that ſuch as had the charge of teaching, <hi>miniſtred,</hi> or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied <hi>in Baal:</hi> he therein oppoſeth this name, to the true and onely God: as if he ſhould ſay, The doctrine of the word was corrupted by them, becauſe they paſſed their limits, &amp; continued not within thoſe bounds of the true and ſincere doctrine contained in the Law; but mingled many abuſes and corruptions therewith, which they had gotten in together from all parts: to wit, thoſe troupes of gods whom profane people had forged. And yet the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7696:40"/> Prophet inſiſts not vpon the word, or name. For haply thoſe great clerkes pretended the name of the eternall God, yet falſly: but God is no ſophiſter. Neither are the Papiſts at this day to imagine that they differ ought from theſe ancient ſeducers, becauſe they pretend the name of one God: for it hath euer been ſo. It is not of yeſterday that Satan hath begun to transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light; but in euery age theſe Doctors haue on this manner reached forth their poyſon; that is, all their errours and deceits, in this golden cup. Although the Prophets then at that time boaſted they were ſent of God, and that with open mouth they feared not to ſtile themſelues the ſeruants of the God of <hi>Abraham:</hi> yet all this was but wind: for they intermingled therewith the corruptions which they had learned from the wicked ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>It followes: <hi>And they went after thoſe that profited them nothing.</hi> He againe amplifies their fault by a cloſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, namely, that they had deſpiſed him, whom by ſo many experiences they had knowne to bee their father, and author of their ſaluation; whoſe power (as you would ſay) they had felt with their hands: all which notwithſtanding, they ceaſed not ſtill to follow their owne inuentions; albeit they ſaw nothing in any of their idols, which might bee of worth to draw the affections of the Iſraelites to the liking of them. Seeing therefore they followed their vaine and fruitleſſe deceiuings; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their crime is made ſo much the more odious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable.</p>

For it is an ordinary cuſtome among hypocrites, ſhameleſly to ſhake of all feare, but then eſpecially when the Lord hath once made them feele the rod. Why ſo? Becauſe they imagine hee will content himſelfe to haue puniſhed their wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes once. But in the meane while they doe not ſo much as dreame that he corrects the ſinnes of men but lightly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thereby to bring them to repentance; yea, and that albeit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he be ſeuere, yet he fauours his blowes, to the end he may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſtill leaue place for hope: alſo, that ſinners in looking for pardon for their tranſgreſſions, might ſo much the more cheerfully returne backe againe into the right way.

As for example, if God brings vpon ſome countrey, or city, bee it warre, plague, or famine; whileſt the ſmart laſts you ſhall ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terrified, &amp; grieued: and the greater part who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in this kind, will mourne, ſigh, &amp; lament: but God no ſooner giues them any reſpite, but they ſhake their eares (as they ſay) and with the dog returne vnto their vomit; neuer calling to mind their faults formerly committed. Hypocrites therefore muſt of neceſſity be brought to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand (as we ſee <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heere doth) that God ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects mens ſinnes, that he ceaſeth not for all that to hold on his authority and right euen to future times, when hee ſees men ſo refractary and headſtrong, that they profit nothing by all the chaſtiſements he inflicts vpon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet then</hi> (ſaith he) I make no queſtion but this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did much exaſperate the minds of this nation. For,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7696:41"/> not fearing ſo preſumptuouſly to murmure againſt God (as in many places we ſee they did) where they ſticke not to tell him to his face that his wayes were thornie,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.25. and 33.20.</note> and (as it were) full of briars: it is not hard to iudge whether they ſpared the Prophets or no, as wee ſhall ſee in due place. For they impoſed very odious names vpon the Prophets; what? Theſe Prophets haue nothing in their mouthes but Burthens, Burthens: as if (belike) God meant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to thunder againſt vs; better it were for vs to ſhut our eares, than thus ſtill to haue them beaten with ſuch menaces, ſeeing they bring nothing with them but feare and terrour.

                  <p>This then is the Prophets meaning when he ſaith,<note place="margin">The ſumme.</note> 
                     <hi>Goe to the iles of Chittim and ſend to Kedar.</hi> On the one ſide he heere comprehends Greece; and on the other ſide the Eaſt: but it is by taking a part for the whole. For the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes (as wee haue ſeene in <hi>Daniell</hi>) call the Greekes <hi>Chittim:</hi> although others are of opinion, that by this word the Macedonians are vnderſtood. But without all controuerſie, vnder this word, he comprehends al Greece; and not onely the iles of the Mediterranium ſea, but all Europe: ſo that this word extends it ſelfe to all theſe parts, to wit, to all France, and Spaine. I grant that this word is ſometime taken apart; but when it is taken ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the Hebrewes (as I haue ſaid) haue been wont to ſpeake of the French, Spaniards, Germans, and Grecians. Now in that they call the regions farre remote from the ſea, <hi>iles;</hi> it is becauſe they had not much traffique with nations farre off: ſo as they eſteeme all to be iles, which lie beyond the ſea. And the Prophets alſo follow that phraſe of ſpeech, which was vſually receiued of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort. He commands them then <hi>to goe to the iles,</hi> or to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7696:42"/> the regions, as well Southward, as Northward. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee willes them on the contrary to ſend towards the Eaſt, and to conſider the ſtate thereof, as well into Arabia, as to India; to the Perſians, and other regions. For vnder this word <hi>Kedar,</hi> he comprehends all the nations of the Eaſt: but he chiefly mentions Kedar, in regard they were a more barbarous people than any of the Medes or Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or ſuch as were moſt renowned: which hee doth of purpoſe to diſgrace the Iewes. <hi>Goe then, or ſend through all the parts of the world, and ſee and conſider diligently: ſee and ſend:</hi> as if hee meant to ſay, The Iewes are growne ſo ſenſeleſſe, that it is impoſſible to recouer them <hi>with one word, or a bare admonition.</hi> This is the reaſon then why he exhorts them ſo carefully <hi>to enquire;</hi> notwithſtanding the thing were more than apparant already. But (as I haue ſaid) this ſo diligent an enquiry, is not to bee referred to the difficulty of the fact; but it is to conuince the Iewes, who were become ſo ſottiſh and peruerſe, that albeit their owne conſciences conuicted them of impiety, yet they ceaſed not for all that, to ſooth themſelues vp ſtill in their vices. He ſaith then, <hi>Truly, Goe to the iles,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>ſee if the like thing be done:</hi> that is to ſay, you ſhall not poſſibly meete with the like fearefull and prodigious thing.</p>
                  <p>The expoſition followes, namely <hi>becauſe no nation had changed their Gods, which yet were no Gods:</hi> that is, <hi>religion is ſo ſetled and eſtabliſhed amongst all other nations, that they will not by and by change their Gods, but they will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thoſe whom they haue receiued by tradition from their fathers: and yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were no Gods.</hi> If he had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, There is no nation that hath changed their Gods, it had not gauled the impiety of the Iewes ſo much to the quicke. But the Prophet takes this for granted, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer inuentions and ſuperſtitions raigned amongſt the Gentiles, proceeded from no other fountaine, than meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ignorance; and yet notwithſtanding they claue ſtedfaſtly and conſtantly to their inuentions: neither
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7696:42"/> doth the Lord ſay this, as if hee praiſed them for it: his meaning is not that this obſtinacy of the Gentiles deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any ſuch things at his hands, becauſe they neuer ſhranke from their ſuperſtitions: but in regard of his own people, this conſtancy might ſeeme (after a ſort) praiſe-worthy. We ſee then how theſe members ſhould be read all with a breath, thus: <hi>Although there be no nation vnder heauen but you, that worſhippeth the true God; yet their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (ſuch as it is) they conſtantly hold; but you haue diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forſaken me, (me, I ſay) who am not ſome fained thing, but your glory.</hi> The words next inſerted heere, are ſet as oppoſite to theſe vaine fallacies of the Heathen Gods, when he ſaith, <hi>my people haue changed their glory.</hi> For they knew right well, and that not onely as they were taught in the Law, but by moſt infallible experiences alſo, <hi>that God was their glory:</hi> yet could not this with-hold them from forſaking him. It is as much then as if <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had ſaid, <hi>All nations at the laſt day ſhall riſe vp in iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſraell.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe ſuch an obſtinate perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo foule an errour, will manifeſt, that the Iewes are therefore the onely Apoſtataes, in that they haue forſaken the true God: yea, euen that God, who had openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his power and magnificence in their ſight. <label type="milestone">

The Prophet had ſaid, Goe to forraine countreys; and ſee if any nation haue changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods, but meere fictions and lies.

Thus then if I reiect that which I know will yeeld me profit, to chuſe that which will bee hurtfull vnto me: ſhall not ſuch a choyce manifeſt to all, that I am out of my wits? You ſee what the Prophet meanes then in this place, when he ſaith, This people not onely failed in forſaking the true God, but that without any reward at all, they ranne after idols, which could doe them no good.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He ſaith, <hi>they committed two euils:</hi> firſt, in forſaking
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7696:44"/> God; ſecondly, in following falſe gods, ſuch as mens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> braine had forged. But the better to amplifie the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the crime, he vſeth a ſimilitude, when hee calleth God <hi>the fountaine of liuing waters:</hi> and compares the idols <hi>to leaking and broken ceſternes, which can hold no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> If any man ſhould leaue <hi>a liuing fountaine,</hi> to get vnto himſelfe <hi>a ceſterne;</hi> were it not a great folly? For ceſterns are alwayes ſubiect to leake, and to bee drawne dry, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be ſupplied with water by ſome other meanes: but a fountaine hath the ſpring in it ſelfe. Moreouer, look, where there is a vaine of liuing waters, (that alwayes runs and neuer failes) there the water is beſt and wholſomeſt. Raine waters which fal from the clouds into a ceſterne are neuer ſo wholeſome as thoſe which flow naturally from a liuing vaine. But what ſay you then, when the veſſell ſhal not be fitting to retaine the water, but ſhall ſtill bee leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and running out, becauſe of the diuers creuiſes which are thetein? You ſee then how God by this ſimilitude taxeth the folly of the people, for forſaking him, albeit he was <hi>a fountaine;</hi> yea, <hi>a fountaine of liuing waters.</hi> And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the people alſo deſired to chuſe things of no worth, when they gaue themſelues to dote vpon idols. For what good is to be found in them? truly a ſhape and reſemblance onely. For the ſuperſtitious ſort thinke they looſe not their labour, whileſt they honour thoſe gods which themſelues haue deuiſed, but looke for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence at their hands. There are ſome formes then you ſee in falſe religions: and therefore the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares theſe falſe gods to pits, in regard of their depth and hollowneſſe: but in the meane while not a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be found in them. Why ſo? Becauſe they are crackt and broken ceſternes. Now we haue the Prophets mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to wit, we can no way excuſe our ſelues from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found worthy of condemnation, when we forſake the true and onely God. Why ſo? Becauſe in him wee haue the fountaine and well-ſpring of all benefits, whereout we may draw our fill. Shall we then deſpiſe Gods libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7696:45"/> which is able perfectly and fully to make vs happy? Oh, how great is ſuch an vnthankfulneſſe and peruerſity! and yet ſhal God notwithſtanding be alwaies vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able like himſelfe. Wherefore if hee bee iuſtly ſtiled <hi>the fountaine of liuing waters;</hi> ſuch an one will he be vnto vs at this day, if we hinder him not by our, owne malice. In the meane while the Prophet addes another crime to the former: for wee no ſooner turne our backes vpon God, but our hopes will forthwith faile vs. And howſoeuer for a time we may imagine we haue <hi>pits,</hi> or rather fountains; yet come we once to ſtand in need of them, wee ſhall not find ſo much as one drop of water in all our fond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but <hi>ceſterns,</hi> meerely dry and void of liquor.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7696:45"/> he ſets downe the cauſe it ſelfe.

                  <p>Laſtly, he addes in verſ. 17. <hi>Is not this done vnto thee?</hi> Againe, this <hi>interrogation,</hi> is as much as a double affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for it puts the thing out of queſtion (as wee vſe to ſpeake.) as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>What cauſe canſt thou alleage that thou art in this wofull taking, and that euery one hath ſet himſelfe againſt thee, ſo as thou art made a prey to the whole world? Whence (I pray thee) haue theſe things come vnto thee? Haue they not proceeded from thine owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi> We now ſee the Prophets meaning. But that wee may yet vnderſtand him more throughly, it is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that God heere calles the benefits which hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the Iewes to mind, to ſhame them withall. In regard the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> then, had receiued ſo many ſingular gifts and graces from God, that they were eſteemed before all the world beſides: this their dignity is ſet before them, but to their diſgrace. As if hee ſhould ſay, God hath not deceiued thee in promiſing to deale li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7696:46"/> with thee: his adopting of thee to be his ſon, was no fabulous nor vaine thing. Thou then ſhouldeſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly haue been the moſt happy nation in the world, had not thine owne wickedneſſe procured vnto thee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Now ye ſee the reaſon of the Prophets demand, <hi>Is Iſrael a ſeruant? or, borne in the houſe?</hi> By nature indeed they were no whit better than any other nation: but in regard God had choſen them to bee his peculiar inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and had giuen them ſo excellent a prerogatiue; therefore the Prophet now askes <hi>whether they be ſeruants</hi> or no. As if he ſhould ſay, Whence is it, that wee ſee not that happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe ſhine in thee now, which God once promiſed vnto thee? For this is certaine, God for his part deceiues none. It muſt needes follow then, that thou haſt by thine owne deſerts procured vnto thy ſelfe theſe miſeries.</p>
                  <p>And when he ſaith, <hi>why then is he ſpoyled?</hi> Hee ſhewes that if he had not been depriued of Gods protection, hee ſhould not in ſuch ſort haue bin made a prey to the luſt of his enemies. He was laid open to the ſpoyle then, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had forſaken him:<note place="margin">Deut. 32.30.</note> as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſong of <hi>Moſes, How ſhould one of you chaſe a thouſand: &amp; two</hi> of you <hi>put ten thouſand to flight, except our ſtrong God had ſold vs, and that the Lord had ſhut vs vp?</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> there cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puts the people in mind, of what, and how many noble and admirable victories they had obtained ouer their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: and by meanes thereof he left it to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſucceſſors that ſhould be afflicted, whence this change came; namely, that there needed but one enemie to chaſe a thouſand: that is, notwithſtanding they ſhould be the greater part,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.5.6.9.</note> yet their enemies ſhould put them to flight. But what was the cauſe of this? For in former times they were not wont to turne their backs vpon their enemies, but contrariwiſe to driue them before them: it followes then that they were thus captiuated not of men, that purſued them; but of God. Alſo the Prophet in this place ſhewes, that Iſrael <hi>was not made a prey;</hi> but in regard
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7696:46"/> that God had left them ſuccourleſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he addes, <hi>The Lions roared vpon him.</hi> It ſeemes the Prophet compares not Iſraels enemies to Lions ſimply, in reſpect of their cruelty; but rather by way of contempt: as if hee ſhould ſay, Iſrael not onely feeles men his aduerſaries, but euen wild and ſauage beaſts. Now this is a greater reproch, when God ſuffers vs to be torne in pieces by wild beaſts. It is as much then as if he had ſaid, Iſrael is thus miſerably handled, that hee is not onely expoſed to the power and will of man to bee put to death, that is, by the hands of his enemies, but is euen <hi>made a prey to bruit beaſts.</hi> And he addes here, <hi>that they yelled,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Iſrael who was wont to be protected by Gods powerfull hand, is now become the food of cruell and rauenous beaſts: ſo as the Lions with enuie roare (as it were) vpon him. Then without any metaphor he addes, <hi>that his land is laid waſt, and his Cities burnt without an inhabitant:</hi> neither indeed doth this ſute either to Lions, or to other cruell beaſts: but what he ſpake before figuratiuely, hee heere expounds himſelfe plainly; <hi>Thy land is waſted, thy Cities are burned,</hi> or, <hi>raſed to the ground.</hi> This (as I haue ſaid) could not haue fallen out, vnleſſe Iſraell had been forſaken of God, &amp; conſequently depriued alſo of his ſuccour &amp; protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>To amplifie this diſcourſe, he addes, <hi>Alſo the children of Noph and Taphnos ſhall breake thine head.</hi> Wee ſhall ſee hereafter that the Iſraelites were wont to ſeeke for helpe from the Egyptians: and this particle <hi>yea,</hi> or, <hi>alſo,</hi> may be thus expounded: not onely ſhall thoſe who haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhewed themſelues thy open and deadly foes make warre againſt thee, but <hi>euen thy confederates;</hi> vpon whoſe power thou reliedſt? <hi>euen theſe</hi> ſhall turne their forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and ſhall breake thine head; or the crowne of thy head. Some are of opinion that this is ſpoken by way of reproach; and to ſhame them, in regard the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians were cowards: ancient hiſtories alſo teſtifie that in Egypt, men dealt in thoſe affaires, which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7696:47"/> to women. But becauſe the Scripture is not wont to teſtifie thus much, nor to ſpeake in this ſenſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians; I had rather follow that which is moſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to wit, that the Egyptians (who notwithſtanding they were Iſraels confederates) ſhould become their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: yea that they were their enemies already. By the <hi>top,</hi> or <hi>crowne,</hi> ſome vnderſtand the Princes and heads of Iſrael: but we may expound it according to our vſuall manner of ſpeaking, <hi>They ſhall breake, or they ſhall rub, or chafe thine head:</hi> and this ſenſe in my iudgement ſutes beſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon followes, why this came to paſſe: <hi>Hath not this been done vnto thee?</hi> (ſaith he) Others tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, Haſt not thou done this? in the ſecond perſon. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, the ſenſe is all one. And yet it ſeemes the opinion of others is better, <hi>Hath not this been done vnto thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou hast forſaken the Lord thy God?</hi> In a word, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> ſhewes, that the falling away of the people, was the cauſe of all their chaſtiſements. As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, Such broth as you haue made, euen ſuch ſup you off; and know that thou canſt not any way charge the Lord as being blame-worthy; for he is ready to performe that which he hath promiſed, did not thine owne impiety hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. Neither hath God indeed choſen thee in vaine; neither hath hee without cauſe preferred thee before all other nations; onely thou haſt reiected and put backe his benefits and liberality from thee. Thus then thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had neuer been as now it is, if thy ſelfe hadſt not procured theſe euils to thy ſelfe. And how is that? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt forſaken thy God.</hi> And hee doth againe aggrauate the fault in ſaying, <hi>In the time when hee led thee by the way.</hi>

                     <hi>To leade by the way,</hi> is as much as to gouerne rightly and happily. Thus the Prophet ſhewes that their diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and backſliding was vtterly inexcuſable, in that they had reiected the worſhip and ſeruice of God: for then things went proſperouſly forwards. Had they been preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7696:47"/> with many tentations, they might thus haue made their excuſe, wee thought our expectations ſhould haue failed vs, whileſt we waited for deliuerance from the true God. Why ſo? Becauſe hee with-held the ſignes of his preſence from vs; therefore neceſſity conſtrained vs: at the leaſt, that which we haue done inconſiderately ought to be pardoned. For what could we thinke elſe, but that God had forſaken vs? This obiection our Prophet heere preuents, as in the fifth verſe of this chapter; <hi>What iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty haue your fathers found in me?</hi> And in another place, <hi>O my people, what haue I done vnto thee, teſtifie againſt me?</hi> Mich. 6.3. For God in that place is ready to iuſtifie his cauſe, and to cleere himſelfe of whatſoeuer accuſations the people could charge him with. So heere, <hi>I haue lead thee by the way:</hi> that is to ſay, thou wert in good caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder my leading and gouernment; and yet could neither my goodneſſe, nor louing kindneſſe keepe thee in awe, though I dealt graciouſly with thee: no though thou kneweſt thou couldeſt no way better thine eſtate, then to be vnder my cuſtody; yet thou louedſt rather to follow after idols. What excuſe therefore haſt thou now? or what ſhew of excuſe canſt thou alleage for thy ſelfe? We ſee then how the fault of the people is ſo much the more aggrauated, becauſe they then forſooke their God, when they were no way forced thereunto by any tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being growne meerly diſloyall, they voluntarily gaue themſelues to the ſeruice of idols. Now this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the verſe following.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet (as I touched before) confirmes that which I haue ſaid; namely, that the people could not chalenge the Lord, as being the author of their euils, ſeeing the whole cauſe thereof, reſted in themſelues. And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7696:48"/> yet the fault is redoubled, in regard they ſought here and there after ſuch remedies which profited them nothing at all: by meanes whereof alſo they alwayes heaped new iudgements vpon their owne heads. For we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that their onely remedy in afflictions was to ſeeke reconciliation with God.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> For example, if a ſicke man knowes whence the cauſe of his ſickneſſe comes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward (in ſtead of ſeeking fit remedies) he betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſome medecine which ſhall doe him no good, but will rather be a meanes to encreaſe the malady; will wee not iudge ſuch an one worthy to periſh, ſeeing hee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly &amp; willingly reiected thoſe remedies which would haue done him good, to runne after vaine and deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able medecines, thinking to find comfort by them? This is the very thing which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heere reprooues in the Iſraelites: If thou carefully enquireſt (ſaith he) whence ſo many afflictions proceed, thou ſhalt find me guiltleſſe, and thine owne iniquities to bee the cauſe. But what is now to bee done? what courſe art thou now to take? euen this: bethinke thy ſelfe well how thou maiſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with me, and how thou maiſt obtaine pardon: endeauour to bee reuenged on thy ſelfe for thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus ſhall thy plagues be ſoone remoued, and by experience thou ſhalt find me the beſt phyſicion,<note place="margin">God the beſt phyſicion.</note> if thou thus addreſſe thy ſelfe vnto me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But what dooſt thou now?</hi> Thou trotteſt vp and downe, hunting after vaine and deceiueable comforts. <hi>Now thou fleeſt to Egypt; and by and by to Aſſyria:</hi> but by none of theſe meanes canſt thou procure vnto thy ſelfe any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Now wee haue the Prophets meaning: for hauing conuinced the Iewes of their impiety, and hauing ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to vnderſtand that they could neither aſcribe the euils which they endured, to God, nor to Fortune, no nor yet to any other cauſes: he now ſhewes, that the onely remedy, and the beſt way to attain ſaluation, is to returne into fauour with God. But to runne hither and thither; <hi>now into Egypt, now into Aſſyria;</hi> they therein diſcouered
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7696:48"/> an euident ſigne of deſperate folly. Now this reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion depends vpon the holy hiſtory. For this people had one while the Aſſyrians their enemies, an other while the Egyptians, in regard there ſtill happened great mutations and changes: and God alſo laid diuers troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vpon them, the better to awaken them out of their drowſineſſe and ſecurity. Sometimes he hiſſed for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, as wee ſhall ſee afterwards: then hee cauſed his trumpet to ſound into Aſſyria: and all to certifie the Iſraelites that no peace was euer to be looked for, till they quietly ſubmitted themſelues vnder Gods gouernment. And yet the people reiecting this counſell, were ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that when the Aſſyrians aſſailed them, then they fled to Egypt, that is to ſay, they ſought for ſuccour of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, and made a league with them. But if any change happened, then they ſought and deſired to bee confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with the Aſſyrians, yea and often to purchaſe their friendſhip at a very deare rate.</p>
                  <p>This is that frenſie then, wherewith the Prophet heere taxeth them, when he ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou to doe in the way of Egypt?</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>I pray thee what good getteſt thou by it? what madneſſe is it in thee, when thou manifeſtly feelest that God is against thee, that thou then thinkeſt not of the right meanes whereby thou mighteſt procure thine owne welfare; namely, by ſeeking reconciliation with thy God? All thy health conſiſts in fleeing to God, in ſeeking to get his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and in ſuing for mercy at his hands. But what courſe takeſt thou? Thou runneſt to Egypt, thou runneſt to Aſhur. Bringeſt thou not thy ſelfe thus into a wofull plight? What childiſhneſſe is it in thee, thus to vexe thy ſelfe to no purpoſe?</hi>

I grant hee alludes to the Ambaſſadours which were ſent: becauſe in their trauell, ſome dranke of the waters of Nilus, and others of the waters of Euphrates: and yet notwithſtanding he ſpeakes by way of allegory; as if he ſhould ſay, God was ready to ſuccour thee, hadſt thou but reſorted to his mercy, as to a city of refuge: but thou thoughteſt it better to neglect him, that thou mighteſt haue helpe from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians: Thou ſeekeſt then to drinke the waters of farre countries; whileſt God ſupplies thy neceſſities with ſufficiency of waters at home.</hi> It may be alſo, he alludes to that ſimilitude hee vſed in ver. 13. he there called God the fountaine of liuing waters: as if he ſhould haue ſaid; God would bee to thee an euer-ſpringing fountaine, that can neuer bee drawne dry: neither ſhouldeſt thou euer periſh for thirſt, if thou wouldeſt content thy ſelfe with him alone: but thou thirſteſt after the waters of Nilus and Euphrates. Thus we haue now attained the Prophets meaning. Neither is it to be doubted, but he ſpeakes of the waters <hi>of Nilus and Euphrates;</hi> becauſe both theſe nations in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance abounded in al ſorts of riches, and in multitudes of men. Seeing Iſrael then relied vpon ſuch defences, the Prophet heere blames their ingratitude, in that they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied not themſelues with thoſe ſuccours which God affoorded them; albeit the ſame appeared not vnto them in ſo manifeſt and viſible a ſort as the others did.<note place="margin">An excellent and fruitfull inſtruction.</note> For in God we haue all ſufficiency: and if himſelfe alone could content vs, certanly hee would giue vs more than wee

Wee haue the Prophets meaning then. It followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt know how bitter and euill a thing it is:</hi> This muſt be referred to the chaſtiſements: yet he goes on ſtill with that which he ſaid before; namely, that the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the people then endured, came not vpon them by chance, ſo as being now preſſed with ſo bitter and ſharpe afflictions, they were to ſeeke any cauſe thereof from farre, in regard all theſe tedious anguiſhes, and all the ſmart which they felt, proceeded meerly from their owne impiety. <hi>By the recompence</hi> then (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt know, and thine owne wofull experience ſhall conuince thee to thy face, that it is an euill and bitter thing, that thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from thy God:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>from the Lord thy God,</hi> or, To forſake the Lord thy God: for if God had not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his fauours to the Iſraelites, their iniquity had not been ſo odious: but they hauing proued <hi>God to bee their Father;</hi> and ſeeing he had dealt ſo louingly with them, and had done them that honour to eſtabliſh his couenant with them; therefore their wickedneſſe was inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards hee changeth the perſon, <hi>And that my feare was not in thee.</hi> Heere the prophet at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that the people were growne paſt feeling, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, or godlineſſe. For by this clauſe of <hi>the feare of God;</hi> he notes reuerence. Wee know men often fall through errour and ignorance, and otherwhiles are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken through the ſubtilties of Satan, ſo as their miſery is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7696:51"/> to be pitied. But the Prophet heere ſhewes how this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſo inexcuſable, that they are vnworthy any pity or mercy ſhould bee extended to them. Why ſo? Becauſe (ſaith he) there is <hi>no feare of God</hi> at all left in thee: that is to ſay, thou canſt not alleage thou wert ſuddenly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; neither haſt thou any pretext by which thou maiſt couer thy impiety: thy impudency and ſhameleſſe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour is growne notorious and too apparant; for thou ſheweſt that there is no feare of God in thee.</p>
                  <p>In the end he addes, <hi>ſaith the Lord of hoſts:</hi> by which words the Prophet addes the greater authority to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

And for my part, I rather thinke that God heere complaines that the people turned that liberty which hee gaue them, into licentiouſneſſe: which alſo agrees very well, as wee may eaſily iudge by the ſcope of the text. <hi>Becauſe of long time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I haue broken thy yoke, I haue broken thy bands;</hi> therefore thou haſt ſaid: (for <hi>vau,</hi> which is heere in the Hebrew, ſhould be reſolued into a particle illatiue, Therefore thou ſaidſt) <hi>I will not ſerue,</hi> that is to ſay, in ſtead of giuing thy ſelfe to mee who had redeemed thee; thou thoughteſt thou mightſt take liberty to doe what thou wouldeſt: and the reaſon which hee yeelds of his ſpeech ſutes very well; <hi>For thou ranst vpon euery high mountaine, and vnder euery greene tree; harlot that thou art.</hi> God ſhewes then, that he hath ill beſtowed the grace and benefit of redemption vpon ſuch graceleſſe ones, who thus abuſed their liberty. For they tooke occaſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ouerflow in all laſciuiouſneſſe. But if any had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow the other reading, I will not gainſay him: and then the ſenſe will be, It is long agoe ſince I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened thee of thy yoke, and brake thy bands: but <hi>thou haſt ſaid,</hi> that is, thou didſt promiſe me (for he ſpeaks of this people as of a woman) which is the cauſe that it is put heere in the feminine gender; as alſo in regard that God held the place of an husband towards his people; therefore he no ſooeer accuſeth them of diſloyalty, but he by and by ſpeakes vnto them as an husband doth to a ſhameleſſe woman, who hath giuen ouer her ſelfe to the committing of adultery. <hi>Thou therefore haſt ſaid vnto me,</hi> that is to ſay, thou didſt promiſe me, <hi>that thou wouldest not paſſe,</hi> that is, that thou wouldeſt aſſuredly keepe thy ſelfe chaſt, and loyall to me alone. And thus in ſtead of the particle <hi>ki,</hi> which among the Hebrewes is a note of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the cauſe, we may put in the place of it an aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7696:52"/> to wit, Notwithſtanding, it being ſo taken in other places of the Scriptures. <hi>But,</hi> or, <hi>Notwithſtanding then, thou haſt runne vpon euery high mountaine, &amp;c.</hi> as harlots are wont to doe, in ſeeking their maintenance. But (as I haue ſaid) I rather thinke that God complaines heere of his people, in that by the fauour hee ſhewed them touching their deliuerance, and freeing them from the yoke, they thereby tooke occaſion to giue ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to all diſſolute behauiour. For thus the text runnes very well; and all the parts and members thereof concur very fitly one with another.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Lord puts them in mind <hi>of breaking their bands; and burſting their yoke:</hi> ſome referre this onely to the firſt redemption. But I miſlike not of their opinion, who thinke the Prophet ſpeakes of many deliuerances. For we know the Iſraelites were not for once onely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the land of Egypt, but that God euer &amp; anon ſtretched forth his hand, aſſoone as they were afflicted and oppreſſed. <hi>He had long ſince then taken the peoples yoke from of their neckes:</hi> but it was at ſundry times, as we may perceiue by the hiſtory of the Iudges.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Nehem.</hi> 9.28</note> Seeing the peoples liberty then proceeded meerly from Gods free bounty, who had for the ſames ſake redeemed them; ought they not to haue yeelded themſelues obedient to their Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? For the people were therefore ſet at liberty,<note place="margin">The end why God redeemes vs.</note> that they ſhould wholly dedicate themſelues to his ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Thus then God heere accuſeth the ingratitude of this people, becauſe they imagined hee thus deliuered them, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that they might afterwards reſemble wild beaſts, as wee ſhall ſee hereafter. That wee may the better vnderſtand the Prophets meaning then, we muſt haue an eye to that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in Rom. 6. namely, that whileſt we ſerue ſinne, wee are freed from Gods righteouſneſſe. for then we runne after our luſts, and haue no bridle left, to keepe vs in. But after God hath once ſet vs free from this wofull ſeruitude vnder ſinne; then wee begin to be ſeruants vnto him and his righteouſneſſe. And thus being
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7696:53"/> freed and deliuered from ſinne, wee become ſeruants of righteouſneſſe: this is the end of our redemption. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſe this grace of God, taking occaſion thereby to breake foorth into all intemperancy; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> behauing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo inordinatly as if there were no law, nor rule to keepe them within the bounds of holineſſe and honeſty. This is the cauſe then why God complaines of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; <hi>But thou ſaidſt, I will not ſerue:</hi> for it is too groſſe an ingratitude; yea it is too much that thou haſt done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to dreame that I haue not redeemed thee: as alſo not to vnderſtand that my meaning, in vſing thee with ſuch reſpect, was to teach thee that thou wert wholly mine. For he that is redeemed by another, is no more his owne:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1. Cor. 6.19.20</hi> What Condition redemption containes in it.</note> God had redeemed this people; and therefore the redemption contained in it an obligation, binding the people ouer, to yeeld voluntary obedience vnto God, and to be gouerned by him. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid</hi> then, <hi>I will not ſerue.</hi> Thus God complaines that he hath ill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benefits and graces which hee beſtowed vpon the people: in regard they abuſed the liberty hee gaue them, to all exceſſe of riot.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon which followes, manifeſts it yet better; <hi>For thou runneſt as an harlot</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>vpon euery high mountaine, and vnder euery greene tree.</hi> For we know that the Iſraelites no ſooner reuolted from Gods true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but they choſe them places here and there; as if the tops of the mountaines, and ſhadowie places vnder greene trees, had had more holines in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than any other. And euen thus it fares with the Papiſts at this day: for their deuotion, that is to ſay, that diuelliſh fury which tranſports them from place to place, is the very ſame. Oh (ſay they) ſuch a place is holier, and better than that. So did the Iſraelites; for they thought themſelues nearer heauen, when they <hi>were mounted aloft vpon the tops of the hils:</hi> likewiſe they thought they they had more familiar acceſſe to God, <hi>when they were below vnder the thicke ſhade.</hi> And we ſee alſo how euery profane man almoſt, is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7696:53"/> bewitched after the ſame manner. For when they are on the mountaines, they thinke that makes them nearer to God: they alſo imagine that ſome diuinity is ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as well by the riuers ſides, as vnder greene trees. For as much then as this ſuperſtition had long continued among the Iſraelites, God heere thus reprocheth them, <hi>for their running and wandring to and fro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ſimilitude which hee vſeth muſt be obſerued. For he compares them <hi>to harlots,</hi> who hauing caſt off all ſhamefaſtneſſe, trudge hither and thither, not onely to ſatisfie their baſe and filthy luſts; but alſo their inſatiable couetouſneſſe, whlch ſets them ſo on gog. He ſaith then, <hi>Thou ranneſt about vpon euery mountaine, and vnder euery leaued tree, like an harlot;</hi> or, <hi>harlot that thou art:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, See the reward thou gaueſt me for my mercy in redeeming thee: thou thinkeſt thou haſt obtained leaue now to ouerflow now in all impiety. Thinke well then what hath occaſioned thee thus to proſtitute thy ſelfe to all villany and wickedneſſe. It followes.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7696:54"/> Church to a vine: generally he tearmes it his heritage, or poſſeſſion: but in regard the vine is more excellent than all other poſſeſſions (for they haue been wont to prefer it before medow ground, or that which is tilled) So then becauſe the vine is the moſt noble and choyce inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; therefore God, to ſhew how greatly he eſteemed his Church; when he mentions it, he giues it rather the name <hi>of a vine,</hi> than of a medow or field.

                  <p>WE haue ſeene already (and the Prophet will alſo often mention the ſame) how the people were become ſo rebellious, that they would receiue no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For the greater part were growne audacious, and become ſo hardened in their ſinnes, that they made no bones at all, ſcornfully to make their replies againſt the Prophets, when they preſſed them home indeed. What? Are not we Gods holy people? Hath he not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and adopted vs? Are not we the ſacred of-ſpring of <hi>Abraham?</hi> For this cauſe the Prophets were faine to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelues on this nanner towards them: for (as wee haue it in our common prouerbe) to a rough horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs a rough rider: the Iſraelites therefore being like to tough and knobby timber, needed to be laid vpon with maine ſtrokes, to maſter their tough and crabbed nature. According to which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> now ſaith, <hi>Though thou waſh thee with ſope, and though thou getteſt to thee all ſtore of fullers graſſe; yet is thine iniquity ſealed before me:</hi> that is to ſay, thou ſhalt get nothing by colouring ouer thy wickedneſſes by goodly pretences: <hi>waſh thee</hi> as much as thou wilt, yet thine iniquity remaines ſealed vp in my ſight. Now the Prophet ſpeakes in the <hi>perſon of God,</hi> that the ſentence of condemnation, which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth vpon the Iſraelites, by which alſo he brings all their goodly flatteries and faire pretexts to nothing,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7696:55"/> might haue the more waight and efficacy, as hath been ſaid. They vſed <hi>allom,</hi> and fullers graſſe, to cleanſe and take out ſpots in clothes: and that is the reaſon why the Hebrew word <hi>Borith,</hi> heere vſed, is often attributed to fullers. But there is no great neceſſity for vs to diſpute whether it were an herbe, or powder, or ſome ſuch like thing: for as touching the ſubſtance, it agrees very well. The Prophet vnder a ſimilitude meant to ſhew, that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites gaine nothing by alleaging their ſmooth excuſes for their defences, when God reprooues them. He ſaith then, that all their labour will be vtterly loſt. And why ſo? <hi>Becauſe their iniquity was ſealed:</hi> that is, in regard they could neuer ſo waſh themſelues, that that which was ſealed, or had receiued a ſtampe vpon it, could be defaced. <hi>Spots</hi> indeed may be gotten out by ſope, or ſome other herbs; but after the ſpots be once ſoaked in, or that the ſtampe hath entred within the thing <hi>ſtamped</hi> or <hi>ſealed,</hi> all the waſhings in the world will profit nothing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch markes are ſo <hi>ingrauen,</hi> that a more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary remedy muſt bee vſed, to effect the ſame withall. So the Prophet here ſaith, <hi>that the ſpots are ingrauen;</hi> and therefore cannot be gotten out, nor aboliſhed, neithey <hi>by ſope,</hi> nor any other herbe.</p>
                  <p>And he ſaith that theſe ſpots are ſealed, <hi>in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> or, <hi>before his face;</hi> in regard it was a very eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Iſraelites to make their excuſes, and to lay all the blame vpon ſome other: yea they were growne to ſuch an impudency, that they durſt openly reſiſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; as if they had offered them great wrong: alſo they ſtucke not to tearme the Prophets, railers, and ſlanderers. This is the reaſon why he ſaith, <hi>thine iniquity is marked before me:</hi> that is to ſay, albeit thou deceiueſt thine owne ſoule with flatteries, and hideſt thine iniquities from men; yet that ſhall nothing profit thee. Why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame <hi>rests ſealed before me.</hi> It followes.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7696:56"/> ſeemes to want words enough to ſet foorth ſuch violent furies, as at that time raigned among the people, vnleſſe he compared them <hi>to Dromedaries.</hi> But for as much as he ſpeakes vnto them in the feminine gender, as vnto a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; therefore hee puts the <hi>female</hi> Dromedary heere. Now I thinke he calles her <hi>ſwift,</hi> not onely becauſe ſhe ranne ſwiftly; but becauſe ſhee is violently carried with heat of luſt, as we ſhall ſee afterwards. This place then giues vs to vnderſtand, that the people were ſo hardened in their euill courſes, that they impudently reiected the reprehenſions of the Prophets. Their impiety was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough: yet were they not aſhamed to make their defences, as if the Prophets had wronged them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, in condemning their follies: neither are we greatly to maruell at ſuch an obſtinacy in the ancient Iewes; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Papiſts are no leſſe headſtrong at this day, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the known and manifeſt truth. For albeit chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are now able to diſcerne of their groſſe and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe idolatries; yet they thinke with one word to excuſe all, when they anſwere vs, that pictures and images are no idols: the Iſraelites indeed (ſay they) were condemned for forging images and puppets; but that was in regard they were inclined to ſuperſtition. And thereupon they cry out againſt vs with open mouth, that wee wickedly ſlander this way of ſeruing God, which hath been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and vſed of them. We ſee, and little babes alſo (after a ſort) may perceiue, that there is no kind of ſuperſtition, which is not receiued, and which hath not full ſway in the papacie; and yet will they needs be held ſincere and innocent, as if in nothing they were blame-worthy. And thus were they wont to doe in times paſt. Now becauſe the Temple then ſtood, where alſo they offered ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (and therefore had ſome ſhew of religion) as oft as the Prophets reproued their wicked corruptions which were mingled therewith (which alſo marred the worſhip of God, and were (as they ordinarily ſpeake) ſo many whored o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7696:56"/> Doe we not worſhip God? This rebellion then is it which the Prophet here goes about to ſubdue, <hi>How dareſt thou affirme,</hi> or ſay, <hi>I am not polluted?</hi> As the papiſts yet ſpeak, Beleeue we not in the true God? Faine we multiplicities of gods? But in the meane while they rob God of his whole power, and rend it into I know not how many pieces: and yet they bluſh not with their more than har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots braſen and ſhameleſſe fore-heads, to affirme, that they worſhip but one God.

Thou art</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Dromedarie, and a wild Aſſe.</hi> For if the wild Aſſe <hi>gathereth in, or ſnuffeth vp the wind, according to the deſire of her ſoule:</hi> that is to ſay, if with full breath ſhe deſireth, and gathereth in the wind by her occaſion, or by her meeting at a venture (for hereby he meant to let vs know, that in ſuch kind of beaſts there is neither diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor any moderation at all.) after then they haue gotten the wind in their ſnout, on which ſide ſoeuer they meete therewith; none can ſtay them, nor keepe them backe from purſuing their violent courſe. For whoſoeuer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7696:57"/> would beſtow his labour to that end, ſhould but labor in vain; vntill the time come in which he may find her in her moneth. By theſe words then, the Prophet giues vs to vnderſtand, that the peoples fury was become altogether vntameable, ſo as it was not poſſible to hold them in, by any meanes whatſoeuer; no more than the wild Aſſe can be reſtrained, or forget that naturall reſtleſneſſe which is in her; but eſpecially after ſhe hath once ſented the wind. Indeed if ſhe were ſhut vp, peraduenture the crib might ſomewhat preuaile with her, from flinging thus furiouſly ouer the fields: but if ſhe may freely take her courſe, ouer mountaines, and through thickets, where ſhe may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and take in the wind, according to her ſoules deſire; that is to ſay, after ſhe may fetch her frisks to and fro, without any hinderance: this is the <hi>wind of occaſion.</hi> For the Prophet calles that <hi>the wind of occaſion,</hi> which falles out by chance: as if hee ſhould ſay, ſuch beaſts are ruled by no reaſon, neither keepe they any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If any one of vs would vndertake a iourney, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> would firſt enquire how farre hee could trauell on a day; for we not onely flee wearineſſe, but (as much as in vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lies) we preuent it: moreouer, hauing conſidered in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe what way to take, he aduiſeth with his hoſt; and not content with that, he requires inſtructions touching that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> way which is moſt direct. But the caſe is otherwiſe <hi>with wild beaſts,</hi> when they take their courſe: for after they haue once <hi>ſet vpon it,</hi> they neither direct their race to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lyons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cities in France.</note> nor <hi>Lawſan,</hi> but fling vp and downe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the toy takes them in the head: and their ſtrength being well ſpent, yet ceaſe they not ſtill to hold on their courſe: for they take their luſt for a law. Now we haue the Prophets meaning.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>Who can ſtay her?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be reſtrained, nor brought back to any meane. Why ſo? becauſe all their ſenſes are fore-ſtalled with this fury, or rage rather.</p>
                  <p>It followes, <hi>No man will wearie himſelfe; ſhee will at the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7696:57"/> laſt be found in her moneth.</hi> All the expoſitors agree in this, that <hi>her moneth</hi> is heere taken for the time in which ſhee is ready to foale; as if he ſhould ſay, After the wild Aſſes be once big, and that their foaling time approacheth, then are they conſtrained to be quiet, by reaſon of their heauie burthen; and then it is no maſterie to take them, becauſe they want that agility of body which they had at the firſt, for they carry their young ones in their belly. And thus the Prophet ſhewes <hi>how the people reſembles wild Aſſes,</hi> in regard no inſtruction whatſoeuer could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepe them in, or moderate their intemperancie: onely <hi>the time of their bringing forth muſt be obſerued.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Application of this ſimilitude to the Iewes. Two parts of this verſe.</note> Now we are to ſee how this ſimilitude is to be applied to this people. This verſe containes two parts: the firſt whereof (as I haue ſaid) ſhewes, that the people could not poſſibly be bowed by any wholſome admonitions, neither would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they obey good counſell; but were tranſported <hi>with inraged luſt, as with the wind of occaſion,</hi> or as with the wind which is firſt met withall. Now there being ſuch an obſtinacy in them, <hi>God heere threatens the hypocrites to come in ſuch a time wherein they ſhall be tame enough:</hi> and that he will ſtill theſe their violent courſes. How? <hi>The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> time of trauell will approach:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>when at the length you ſhall haue conceiued many iniquities, the burthen thereof will ſtop you.</hi> Now he ſignifies <hi>the time of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, You muſt not be handled like men that are in their wits, or of ſound iudgement; for you are <hi>wild beaſts,</hi> that cannot be tamed. What remaines then? Euen as the wild Aſſe is burthened with the waight which ſhe beares in her belly, when the time of her foal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes: <hi>ſo in the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I cauſe you to feele the waight of your iniquities, which will prooue too heauie for you to beare; and indeed will ouerwhelme you.</hi> And yet if ſo be your obſtinacy be ſuch, that it can no way be reclaimed; my hand notwithſtandihg ſhall bee ſufficient to curbe you. For ſeeing you will not bow, nor ſubmit your ſelues to my doctrine, I will cruſh you to pieces. Now then, we

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7696:58"/> wherewith they were carried away after their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and idols. God therefore in this firſt member ſhewes what courſe he tooke with them: for all <hi>the exhortations and ſermons of the Prophets,</hi> tended to no other end, <hi>but to keepe the people quiet vnder Gods gracious protection.</hi> But he vſeth other termes: <hi>Keepe backe thy foot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from being vnſhod, and thy throat from thirſt.</hi> For as ſoone as they perceiued any danger towards, they ranne now into Egypt, then into Aſſyria, as wee haue ſeene before.<note place="margin">See Verſ. 18.</note> God heere complaines of this folly, in that they obeyed not the counſell he gaue them, which was for their benefit and ſaluation. For if God had commanded them to haue fled towards the Eaſt, or Weſt: their replies would haue been ready, The way is too long and tedious for vs: but God onely willed them to keepe them quiet and ſtill at home: what a fury was it then in them not to wait patiently for his ſuccour, but to vexe themſelues, and that for nothing? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in a manner as much; but not in the very ſame words. For hee expoſtulates the matter with them,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.5.7.</note> that they refuſed no trauell, albeit they might haue been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by Gods immediate hand, without fetching ſuch vagaries. We now haue the Prophets meaning. For in the firſt place he ſhewes, that the people were timely admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but they were ſo farre fore-ſtalled with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe counſels, that they would giue the Prophets no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This therefore was a vile ingratitude, <hi>in that they would not ſtay at home quietly,</hi> but rather choſe to take any paines whatſoeuer, though it were vtterly fruitleſſe, <hi>This is your reſt</hi> (ſaith Iſa. 30.15.) <hi>but you would not.</hi> Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not peace, and to be at reſt? All men will confeſſe, it is one of the greateſt benefits that can naturally be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or deſired: and yet the Prophet heere affirmes, the people eſteemed it not. It muſt needs thereupon follow then, that they were become vtterly ſenſeleſſe, in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which euery man naturally deſires; which alſo is ingrauen (as it were) in euery mans breaſt. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet not onely thus teacheth the people, but hee (after a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7696:59"/> ſort) puts them alſo in mind of that which was ſpoken before, by <hi>Iſaiah, Micah,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For God had often exhorted them <hi>to be ſtill:</hi> and therfore the Prophet now enueyes againſt their ingratitude, in that they ſuffered themſelues to be ſo tranſported and carried away by their vnruly paſſions: which was the cauſe they reiected ſo ſingular a fauour and benefit, as God then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them. Let vs obſerue then, that the Prophet repeats that, which the other Prophets had taught before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Keep backe thy foot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from being vnſhod:</hi> that is, put not off thy ſhooes. Others tranſlate, <hi>from nakedneſſe,</hi> becauſe in long iourneys they wore out their ſhooes. But for mine owne part, I rather thinke it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their ordinary cuſtome, becauſe they were wont to walke bare-foot. <hi>Keepe thy foot then from being vnſhod, and thy throat from thirſt:</hi> we all know that drought is a thing which moleſts men much. Thus then the Prophet heere corrects the peoples folly, for ſuffering themſelues to be ſo violently ouercarried with their wicked luſts, that they <hi>procured thirst to themſelues by their long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</hi> In regard then, that God required nothing of them but to ſpare their paines, their fault is redoubled, in that they refuſed to follow ſuch wholeſome counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. For (as I ſaid before) if God had required ought of them that might hardly haue beene performed, they might haue had ſome ſhew of excuſe: but ſeeing hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nothing of them, but to reſt patiently and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in tranquility at home, they were able to ſay nothing for themſelues; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>thou ſaidſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, no.</hi> Here the Prophet ſhewes how the people on the contrary were <hi>rebellious</hi> and headſtrong, in that they proudly ſcorned ſuch ſweet and amiable admonitions. In the firſt place, they ſay, <hi>there is no hope:</hi> the verbe in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſignifies to be deſperate; and thereupon they ſay, <hi>It is a thing deſperate;</hi> vnleſſe any had rather tranſlate, It is a weariſome thing: which ſenſe agrees not ill: as if they ſhould ſay, I am but too much vexed in vaine, ſo as my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7696:59"/> wearineſſe aduertiſeth me to ſit ſtill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No.</hi> The Prophet ſpeakes conciſely, the better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſtubborne behauiour of this people; in ſaying, <hi>the thing is deſperate:</hi> it is all one as if they had caſt all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and exhortations farre away from them: he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards adds; he will doe nothing. There is no verbe in the Hebrew: but this cutted manner of ſpeech hath more efficacy in it (as I haue ſaid) and doth more fully ſet forth the peoples pride and rebellion. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> on the contrary complaines of them, in chap. 57.10. for not ſaying, <hi>It is done, there is no more hope:</hi> and thus it ſeemes that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſhould contradict one another: for <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> heere reprooues the people for ſaying, <hi>there is no hope;</hi>

Theſe words therefore,<note place="margin">How Ieremiah and Jſaiah may be reconciled touching their diuers manner of ſpeaking.</note> 
                     <hi>the thing is deſperate,</hi> ſhewes what a deſperate rebellion there was in the people: for they giue vs to vnderſtand, that they could neuer be reclaimed; and therfore plainly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many circumlocutions auouch, The thing is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reprooues the people, becauſe they ſaid not, There is no hope: that is, in regard that by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, their folly was not conuinced. For hauing often trotted downe into Egypt, and then into Aſſyria, God gaue them to vnderſtand, by their owne experience, how vnaduiſed they were. They might well haue concluded then by the things they had ſeene, that God diſappointed them of their hope, to bring them to a change of their purpoſes. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> therefore rightly ſaith, that the Iewes were growne too ſottiſh, becauſe they neuer ceaſed to follow their blind obſtinacy; and yet perceiued not that God (as you would ſay) had ſet barres and obſtacles in their way, thereby cauſing them to change their courſe, to recoyle backe, and to forſake thoſe vaine hopes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had been ſeduced. Now wee ſee then what a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7696:60"/> good agreement there is betweene theſe two Prophets; albeit their manners of ſpeaking bee diuers. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> brings in the Iewes heere ſpeaking thus cuttedly, to ſet forth their obſtinacy; <hi>There is no hope:</hi> that is to ſay, O ye Prophets, ye ceaſe not ſtill to dull our eares with your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, but it is to no purpoſe: for wee are reſolued what to doe, neither can any euer bee able to reclaime vs. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he accuſeth the peoples madneſſe; in that albeit they had oft been deceiued, both by the Aſſyrians, and Egyptians; yet they knew not that ſuch experiences were to bring them home into the right way, and that they were too headſtrong in following their wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes.</p>
                  <p>As touching this place which now we handle, we ſee what the Prophet meant to ſay; to wit, that God louing- and graciouſly exhorted the Iewes, with quiet mindes to reſt themſelues content with his ſuccour: and yet they were not onely ſtubbornly rebellious, but with haughty and proud ſpirits reiected this fauour, which God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to tender vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Now it followes: <hi>For I haue loued ſtrangers, and them will I follow.</hi> He amplifies the peoples fault, in regard they were giuen to follow ſtrange gods. Hee alſo ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues on the ſame ſimilitude which we mentioned before. For as God on his part, had taken this people into his ſafeguard; ſo were they alſo bound in ſuch ſort vnto him, that it was now become an holy and ſacred band and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betweene God and them: euen like to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the wife is bound to her husband, by the band of marriage. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then in this place proſecutes this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and ſaith, <hi>the Church was become like a ſhameleſſe and wicked ſtrumpet, in regard ſhee would not vouchſafe to giue eare to her husbands admonitions, albeit hee endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby to ſeeke reconciliation with her.</hi> But if a wife ſhould deale thus with her husband, in reiecting his counſell, being ready to returne into fauour with her, and to paſſe by all her former offences; were ſhe not become
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7696:60"/> vtterly deſperate? Thus the Prophet then ſhewes how this people were growne to ſuch a wofull and incurable impiety, that they ſtopped their eares, whileſt God ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and gently called them to repentance: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, hauing browes of braſſe, proudly vaunted, <hi>that as they had loued idols, ſo them would they follow:</hi> albeit therein they reiected the onely true God. It followes.</p>

                        <hi>See chap.</hi> 5.26.</note> The Prophet then compares the Iewes <hi>to theeues</hi> which are taken with the manner: as if he ſhould ſay, the hypocrites that are mingled amongſt this people, gaine little by their cauils and euaſions. Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe their</hi> impiety is apparant to all the world: euen as a theefe who being taken with the manner, can neither denie, nor couer the fact.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7696:61"/> whileſt all the world euidently perceiues their wickedneſſe; which is ſo manifeſt, that they can by no deuices ſo colour it, but it will cleerly bee viewed of all men.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſpeakes he heere of the common ſort only, but he accuſeth the <hi>Kings, Princes, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophets:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, euen all, from the higheſt to the loweſt of them, are ſo corrupted, that without any bluſhing at all, they declared and ſhewed themſelues wicked and open contemners of God, in following their inuentions, and ſuperſtitions. And yet notwithſtanding the Iewes no doubt laboured by all meanes to vphold their owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits: but God heere diſcouers all their iuglings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, whereunder they thought to couer and hide their impieties. For in plaine <hi>Engliſh,</hi> hee ſaith, they are <hi>very theeues,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>euen taken with the manner,</hi> as they ſay. And yet there is no contrariety as touching the ſenſe, though the Prophet ſaith, that the Iewes before ſpake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and now deciphers out, and blazeth their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency. The Iewes denied they were either Apoſtataes or diſloyall: no, they had not ſo much as forſaken the worſhip of God; this they denied in words: but when the Prophet now brings their villany to light, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies are well qualified: for they had their fallacies, as we ſaid before.

He ſhewes then it is not without cauſe, he affirmed that their ſinnes were growne too apparant, and that it was impoſſible for them to excuſe themſelues by any of their euaſions. <hi>For to a tree they ſaid</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>thou art my father, &amp;c.</hi> By theſe words the Prophet would giue them to vnderſtand, that idolatry was ſo roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their hearts, that they ſtucke not to giue that honor which belongs to the liuing God, to their puppets, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>of wood, or ſtone.</hi> But the Prophet in the meane while notes that heere, which is the moſt deteſtable in idolatry; namely, <hi>when that honour which is due to God, is giuen to images; not onely touching that which appeares in outward ſhew, to wit, in kneeling or bowing before them, but when they call vpon them,</hi> and that, <hi>to obtaine helpe and deliuerance from them.</hi> This then is diligently to be obſerued: for the Papiſts when they bow before their images and pictures, if you preſſe them throughly with it, they will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding neuer yeeld that there is any idolatry in this. For in their language they haue gotten a diſtinction,<note place="margin">The Papiſts diſtinction of Latria and Doulia.</note> namely, that they worſhip not their images with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Latria,</hi> but onely with that of <hi>Doulia;</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſeruitude, or ſeruice. And thus they thinke they haue very well quit themſelues.<note place="margin">See Calu. Jnſtit. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi> ſect. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> But albeit wee ſhould grant them all they ſay, yet can they not for all that deny, but they both pray, and direct their vowes vnto their images. Seeing then <hi>they ſeeke deliuerance at their hands,</hi> whatſoeuer they cauill to the contrary, it is meerly vaine and friuolous. For the Prophets condemne not theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſtures: as the bowing of the knee, or other kinds of ceremonies and rites, when they accuſe idolaters in their ſermons. What then? namely, becauſe <hi>they ſay to the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7696:62"/> Images, Thou art my father:</hi> that is to ſay, they fixe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, to images of wood and ſtone. It is very ſure the Iewes neuer became ſo brutiſh, as to ſay in expreſſe tearmes, <hi>that gods of wood and ſtone were their fathers:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they euer vtter any ſuch words: and yet our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet belies them not, although he attributes this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage vnto them.<note place="margin">The Prophets often in their ſermons aime not ſo much at the ſpeeches of idolaters, as at their intent.</note> But as it is euident from other places, the Prophets note not the ſpeech, but the intention. For when the Iewes bowed before images, they did (for all the world) as we ſee the Papiſts doe at this day. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed indeed that they worſhipped one God onely, and it was to him they came for deliuerance: but in the meane while (by your leaue) they thought Gods power was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in thoſe images. And this is the reaſon why they ſay, <hi>Thou art my father, thou haſt begotten me.</hi> So our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts likewiſe, if any of them fall downe before the image of Saint <hi>Katharine,</hi> Saint <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> he will ſay, <hi>Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> but to excuſe the matter, Oh (ſaith he) it is in the honour of God: and yet like a foole thou trotteſt firſt to this image, and then to that, and wilt patter ouer thy <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſter.</hi> Neither is it to bee doubted, but the idolatry now vſed in the Papacy, is more groſſe, and leſſe excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than that which was then among the Iewes. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould ſpeake nothing of the Papiſts patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer their <hi>Pater noſter</hi> thus, before the firſt image they meet withall: yet it is a thing without queſtion, that in offering their vowes and prayers to their images, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe Gods power within them, as if it were fixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. We muſt therefore obſerue, that the Iewes are not onely condemned for cenſing or ſacrificing to their idols; but for attributing the glory of God to ſenſeleſſe ſtockes, and in ſeeking for deliuerance from them. Now becauſe this was not done in expreſſe words, the Prophet notes heere their peruerſe affections; in regard they raiſed not vp their mindes and ſenſes on high vnto God; but thus doted vpon their images. It followes.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>necke vnto me, and not the face.</hi> God
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7696:62"/> heere againe by theſe words, confirmes that which hee ſaid before; namely, that their Apoſtaſie and diſloyalty was ſo manifeſt and notorious, that it could not bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by any of their diſguiſings. In the next words hee addes, <hi>neuertheleſſe</hi> (for the copulatiue <hi>vau,</hi> ought to bee reſolued into an aduerſatiue <hi>notwithſtanding) in the day of their diſtreſſe they will ſay, Ariſe and ſaue vs.</hi> Heere God complaines that the Iewes doe too maliciouſly abuſe his bounty, to wit, that in the time of their greateſt diſtreſſe, they ran to him. But (ſaith he) what haue I to doe with you? you are wholly addicted to your idols, <hi>you call them your fathers;</hi> and to them you attribute the praiſe and glory of your deliuerance; which you doe indeed, whileſt your affaires proſper well: but if your idols once faile you at your need, <hi>then you turne to me ſaying, Ariſe thou and ſaue vs.</hi> But your idols are your fathers, and from them you expect your ſafety: therefore now I haue nought to doe with you: euen ſatisfie your ſelues with your idols ſtill, and trouble me no more, ſeeing you haue reiected me. This is the reaſon why in the next verſe he adds, <hi>Where are thy gods?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> God heere ſcornes that vaine confidence which deceiued the Iewes: <hi>Where are thy gods whom thou haſt forged? Let them ariſe, and let vs ſee what helpe they will affoord thee, in the time of thy affliction.</hi> Wee haue now the Prophets meaning. For hee ſhewes how the people tooke a wrong courſe, in ſeeking to their idols in proſperity; and in the meane while would haue God tied to them, who yet forſooke the true God, in cleauing to thoſe idols. Therefore he ſaith, they were to looke for no helpe from the true God, becauſe they had robbed him of his power, by framing idols to themſelues. For we muſt ſtill remember what hee ſaid before; namely, that the people held the falſe gods for their fathers,<note place="margin">Verſ. 27.</note> and that they were the cauſe of their deliuerance. And it is certaine, that our Papiſts at this day tread euen in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame ſteps. For they haue their patrons and aduocates: but when they ſee all their fond ſuperſtitions to profit
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7696:63"/> them nothing, then they would haue God at their becke: then he muſt helpe at a pinch. But in the meane while, what reſerue they vnto him? For after they haue depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him of all the parts of his honour and glory, to diuide it as a prey among the Saints; yet then would they haue God to ariſe and helpe them. But wee ſee what anſwere God makes to ſuch, <hi>Where are thy gods?</hi>

                     </label> To the end we may benefit our ſelues then, by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; we muſt take heed we tarry not till wee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to know and feele the ſmart by experience, euen when things are at the loweſt ebbe, then to ſee that wee haue loſt our time and our labour, in hoping for ſuccour, and in ſuing to idols:<note place="margin">Jt is alwayes beſt in our grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt ſtraits, to ſue vnto God for his helpe firſt.</note> but rather let vs know, that it is our duties to come directly vnto God, at the very firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, that ſo in our greateſt needs and neceſſities wee may indeed find him ready to helpe and aſſiſt vs. God yet further amplifies this gauling of them; that is, that taunting manner of ſpeech which he vſed before ſaying, <hi>Where are thy gods? Let them now ariſe and helpe thee:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, let them prooue if they can yeeld thee any ſuccour.</p>
                  <p>When he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt as many gods as Cities:</hi> the meaning is, <hi>becauſe the people contented not themſelues with one God; euery City choſe vnto it ſelfe a ſeuerall god. Seeing the caſe ſo ſtands then, that infinite gods are called vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; wherefore come they not now to your ſuccour?</hi> We ſee then that God heere bitterly taunts the diffidence of this people, for not reſting ſatisfied <hi>with one God,</hi> but that they would needs ſeeke out other gods, and that <hi>without number,</hi> verſ. 32. There were many Cities in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deah, and yet had ſo many patrons and aduocates. <hi>One God</hi> might well haue ſufficed,<note place="margin">One God is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſaue all that truſt in him.</note> and would haue manifeſted his help in ſauing them, as oft as they needed. But this one God they deſpiſed; and euery City framed vnto it ſelfe ſundry gods. <hi>Let them come then</hi> (ſaith hee) and ſeeing you truſt in this <hi>multitude;</hi> let them riſe now and helpe you: for I that am but one, you contemne, becauſe I am
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7696:63"/> alone. Wee ſee then what the Prophet meant further to ſay. Now it followes.</p>

Why ſo? Becauſe God holds them already <hi>conuicted,</hi> ſo as they ſhall but looſe their labours, in alleaging this or that for their excuſe.

                  <p>SOme expound the beginning of this verſe, as if God chaſtiſed the Iewes for their vanity, in regard they were all accuſtomed to lying: but the ſecond part of the verſe anſweres not to this. Wherefore it is certaine, <hi>that God complaines heere of the Iewes, becauſe that whileſt hee laboured to bring them into the right way, they grew altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incorrigible:</hi> and we alſo haue the like ſentence in the firſt chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> verſ. 6. I haue loſt all my labour (ſaith the Lord there) in chaſtening you; no part in you is free, no not from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of the foot. In which place God teſtifies that he tried all the remedies he could: but he found the Iewes of ſuch a ſtubborne and rebellious nature, that they were vtterly incurable. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heere handles the ſame argument: and God by this meanes ſo much the more aggrauates the peoples vntowardneſſe and ſtubbornneſſe: thereby giuing them to vnderſtand, that hee not onely laboured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by <hi>words,</hi> to ſee whether the Iewes would receiue any admonition: but alſo by <hi>chaſtiſements and corrections:</hi> and yet in both theſe, that hee ſpent his labour in vaine. Before, he ſpake concerning <hi>inſtruction,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>keepe thy foot from being vnſhod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Se verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Jſa.</hi> 30.7. <hi>to.</hi> 15.</note> 
                     <hi>and thy throat from thirſt.</hi> Thus then the Prophet by Gods commandement had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed them, that they ſhould be ſtill: but all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> were fruitleſſe and vnprofitable. Now hee addes,<note place="margin">A deſperate caſe is that people come vnto, when neither words nor blowes will amend them.</note> that he yet tried a ſecond meanes, to ſee if <hi>correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> would make them wiſe; but they alſo profited by them as little, as by the former. <hi>I haue chaſtiſed you then in vaine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe you haue receiued no correction.</hi> But he ſpeakes of <hi>children,</hi> to ſhew that the whole body of the people was corrupt. For albeit luſts are more hot and boyling in youth, than in aged perſons, yet is there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7696:65"/> not ſuch a rebellion and ſtif-neckedneſſe in them, as in thoſe that are ſtricken in yeeres. Hardly is that diſeaſe cured that is rooted in the bones. When one hath been accuſtomed all his life to deſpiſe God, it is a thing almoſt impoſſible euer to cure ſuch an one of that ſickneſſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if he be once hardened in it: for then a man hath made himſelfe vnfit to receiue <hi>either admonition, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> For age of it ſelfe is very wayward and teſtie; yea, they thinke great wrong is offered them, if they bee reproued. But where there is ſuch audaciouſneſſe and ſtubbornneſſe <hi>in youth,</hi> that they will no more be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nor receiue any reprehenſion; that is more prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtrange. The Prophet then ſhewes that there was no ſincerity nor vprightneſſe at all in this people, ſeeing their <hi>children</hi> reiected all diſcipline. Now we haue the Prophets meaning; to wit, that God had ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in vaine; and therefore hee now ſhewes that the people not onely wanted eares to heare, thoſe holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which were deliuered vnto them; but had alſo ſtiffe neckes which would not bow, <hi>although he corrected them ſeuerely:</hi> ſo as that way alſo hee gained nothing at their hands. It followes. <hi>Your ſword hath deuoured your Prophets.</hi> But I cannot finiſh this now. Let vs pray.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almighty God, ſeeing it pleaſeth thee by thy fatherly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to call vs daily vnto thee, giue vs grace we may not harden our hearts againſt thy holy and wholſome admonitions: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, when it pleaſeth thee alſo to chaſtiſe vs with thy rods, let vs not ſhew our ſelues ſtif-necked againſt thee: but let vs learne quietly to ſubmit our ſelues to thy good word: alſo as oft as thou ſmiteſt vs, grant we may receiue thy corrections, that thus we may profit our ſelues by both theſe meanes: lest otherwiſe we bring downe vpon our owne heads the extremity of thy iudgements, which thou threatenest all hard-hearted perſons withall: but rather giue vs paſſage into thy ſweet and fatherly kindneſſe: yea deale (O Lord) thus fauourably and graciouſly with vs, vntill thou haſt gathered vs into

This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to doctrine, but to the act or thing it ſelfe: as if he ſhould ſay, The Lord by me complaines of you: ſo as though there be no witneſſes, nor any iudge or arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator, yet <hi>ye your ſelues can iudge and perceiue</hi> how things goe, well enough. Wee ſee then that the Prophet hath ſpoken aptly, when he bids <hi>themſelues to regard, or ſee, the word of the Lord:</hi> for by and by hee adds, <hi>Haue I been a deſert to Iſrael?</hi> He appoints the Iewes themſelues then, <hi>to iudge and determine</hi> this matter; to wit, whether they had not taſted of Gods bounty and liberality by their owne experience, and whether they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and forſaken him,<note place="margin">Se verſ. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> as formerly he complained, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was that fountaine of liuing waters; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they digged not vnto themſelues broken ceſternes that could hold no water. Now God ſaith, Whence came this that you haue thus bidden me farwell? Is it in vaine that I haue promiſed to ſhew my ſelfe gracious &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull vnto you? <hi>Haue I therein abuſed or diſappoynted you of your expectation, whileſt you ſerued me?</hi> Seeing then I haue not been vnto you <hi>a barren land,</hi> or a land full of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity <hi>and darkneſſe, namely, wherein the Sunne ſhines not:</hi> ſeeing (I ſay) you haue alwayes found abundance and plenty of all good things in me; how comes it to paſſe now that you are departed and gone away from me?</p>
                  <p>In the next place he adds yet another fault; <hi>Wherefore ſaith my people, we rule, or, are Lords?</hi> The Hebrew verbe heere vſed is diuerſly expounded; becauſe ſome deriue it from one root, and others from another. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, among them that deriue it from one and the ſame root, they varie in their iudgements: for ſome referre it to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7696:67"/> thoſe calamities and afflictions which the Iewes ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: others, to their reuolt. As touching the firſt, thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they vnderſtand it, We are come downe: that is to ſay, we are ouerwhelmed with miſeries, what ſhall it auaile vs to call vpon God? For all our affaires are become vtterly deſperate. Others chuſe a contrary ſenſe, We are gone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> backe; that is, what need the Prophets trouble our eares any more with their clamors: for we are reſolued neuer to returne to God; we haue at once renounced him: let him goe then with all his goodly exhortations, for we will neither heare him, nor doe ought for him: and both are of opinion, that this is a ſpeech of ſuch as are growne deſperate. But we ſee well enough wherein they differ: for the firſt ſort vnderſtand this word, <hi>To deſcend;</hi> of the peoples calamities: the latter ſort take it for their reuolt; to wit, becauſe they had once taken their leaues of God, and would haue no more to doe with him. There is a third ſort who come nearer to the Grammaticall ſenſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the verbe heere vſed in the originall, ſignifies <hi>to rule:</hi> and thus I rather willingly encline to this expoſition, <hi>wee rule:</hi> I alſo thinke, that it is <hi>an arrogant and ſwelling kind of ſpeech;</hi> namely, that the Iewes thought themſelues Kings, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>By this ſimilitude then, God declares how the Iewes were naturally wicked and peruerſe, in that they had thus
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7696:69"/> forgotten ſo ineſtimable a benefit: to wit, in enioying God for their father; and vnder his rule and dominion, enioying whatſoeuer their hearts could wiſh.

                  <p>THis verſe is diuerſly expounded. But the Prophet meant onely to tell <hi>the Iewes that they were like wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton women, who not content to contemne their husbands at home, gad hither and thither; and alſo vſe to trick and trim vp themſelues, the better to allure many to commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with them.</hi> He ſaith then that the Iewes reſembled theſe: and this he calles, <hi>trimming of their waies:</hi> for this verbe hath a diuers ſignification in the Hebrew. It is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to make ready, to decke, to get grace or fauour: but in this place it ſignifies as much as if the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>Wherefore paintest thou thy ſelfe? why diſguiſeſt thou
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7696:69"/> thy ſelfe, as harlots vſe to doe? who to entice fooliſh ſpringals to whoredome, deuiſe many faſhions and artificiall trimmings: why then laboureſt thou ſo earneſtly to obtaine the hire of an harlot?</hi> In the end of the chapter we ſhall ſee to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſaith this: for the Prophet will there reproach the Egyptians and Aſſyrians. But it is a doctrine which is euery where handled in the prophets; for euer and anon they compare the Iewes to courtizans, in regard they (who aboue all others) ought wholly to haue cleaued to their God: (euen as an honeſt wife will not lightly ſuffer her eyes to wander heere and there, neither will ſhee be ſtragling abroad, but ſet her affections wholly vpon her husband) yet they thought it was not onely lawfull, but neceſſary alſo to procure their ſafety; firſt from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians, and then to trot downe into Egypt. It is this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſneſſe of theirs then, which the Prophet heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes in them: and therefore he ſpeakes vnto them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>a ſimilitude,</hi> or borrowed ſpeech: as of the perſon of an adulterous woman, who ſetting light by her husband, runnes after the firſt commers, ſeekes out to her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, and vnaduiſed youthes, and proſtitutes her ſelfe on euery ſide freely to all. Now wee vnderſtand the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets meaning.</p>
                  <p>As touching the words heere vſed by the Prophet, hee ſaith, <hi>wherefore garniſheſt thou thy wayes ſo trimly?</hi> But yet he continues ſtill to compare ſuch a care as this, to the body of an harlot: as if hee ſhould ſay, Why trimmeſt thou thy ſelfe vp thus? What makes thee ſo induſtrious in ſtudying how to decke thy ſelfe with ſuch diuerſities of trimmings and ornaments? Is it not, that by ſuch a decking thou mayeſt the better deceiue the eyes of the ſimple? Out of queſtion the Iewes might (if they would) haue liued in great tranquillity and eaſe, vnder Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and that without any moleſtation at all. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the husband ſatisfies himſelfe with that naturall beauty which his wife hath,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and cares not to haue her paint her face, nor to diſguiſe her ſelfe with artificiall dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7696:70"/> ſo God likewiſe requires nothing of his people, but that they keep their faith &amp; loyalty to him: as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band requires his wife to keepe her body and mind chaſt to him.<note place="margin">The ſumme.</note> The ſumme then is, <hi>that euen as a wife which ſhall liue peaceably and quietly with her husband, hath no need to breake her braines</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>with much carking, becauſe ſhe knowes that naturall beauty God hath giuen her, contents her husband; neither will ſhe with other deuices labour much to gaine her husbands loue, knowing that her chaſtity to him is the best pledge: ſo alſo might you</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>loue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care or trouble, in yeelding onely vnto mee that ſeruice which my Law requires, and in keeping your faith vnuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But what chaſtity call you this, when you imitate ſuch women as are wholly giuen ouer to harlotry, deſiring nothing more, than that they may draw the hearts of adulterers vnto them? for as they burne and are inflamed with luſt; ſo is it their only care how they may find out new deuices, and gauds, thinking they haue neuer enough; and all becauſe they would bend and draw their louers to the liking of them. This</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is your very caſe; for you are neuer wearie in hunting vp and downe after your game: neither ceaſe you to vexe your ſelues in ſeeking out ſtrange louers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he adds, <hi>And therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou hast taught wickedneſſe.</hi> He alludes to that word which hee vſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Truly thou haſt trimmed thy wayes: and heere, <hi>thou haſt alſo</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>taught wickedneſſe in thy wayes.</hi> His meaning is, that the Iewes were worſe than the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Aſſyrians: as in truth a wanton wife is much worſe than any harlot, who takes her followers by her flatteries and enticements. For if ſo bee a young man bee not deceiued elſewhere, and that the diuell (as they ſay) puts not fire to the tow, hee may well continue his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and chaſtity: but if a luſtfull and impudent woman come once to ſeduce him, he is by and by ſnared and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>the Egyptians and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians ſhall bee found innocent, being compared with the Iewes.</hi> Why ſo?

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7696:70"/> by your allurements, euen as young men are enticed and brought to ruine by the cunning deceits, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and attires of harlots. For it fares with them as if vnawares they had been caught in a net: therefore you haue been the authors of all the miſchiefe, and the whole blame reſts vpon you. Thus wee ſee the Prophets mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe Prophet (as farre as I can iudge) repeates that which he ſaid before; namely, that thoſe of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were become altogether deſperately wicked, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that what admonition ſoeuer was giuen them, yet could they neuer be brought to acknowledge their faults: but on the contrary fared like poyſonfull and wild beaſts, in murthering the Prophets, and holy men which were ſent to teach and admoniſh them. Thoſe are miſtaken, who thinke the Prophet here condemnes all the Iewes in generall, in reſpect of their cruelty: and yet all follow this opinion. But queſtionleſſe the Prophet rather amplifies the fault of the Iewes; not onely in that they were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in their euill courſes; but alſo becauſe they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed their cruelties againſt the Prophets of God. And thus he once againe ſhewes, that God vſed all meanes that could be, to cure the Iewes, by bringing them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but nothing would ſerue the turne. For what better remedy could he procure for them, than the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his Prophets, who ſhewed the people how they had looſely and wickedly turned away, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7696:71"/> themſelues from God. See the means then, by which God endeauoured to rebuke the vices which were in his people: but ſo farre was he off from preuailing thereby, that they <hi>murthered the Prophets,</hi> both in Ieruſalem, and in all the coaſts of Iudeah; ſo as all the land was defiled, and repleniſhed with their blood. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>The blood of the ſoules of poore Innocents were found in thy wings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He calles the hemme of their garments, <hi>wings:</hi> as if he meant to ſay, the murthers wherewith he chargeth them were not very ſecret or vnknowne; in regard the blood which the Iewes had ſpilt, was apparantly found euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the vttermoſt parts of their garments.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, I need not now ſtand vpon poynts with you. for your filthineſſe is very manifeſt and apparant: for you haue not onely reſiſted mine admonitions, but you haue cruelly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my Prophets. And if you aske me, Where are theſe murthers? I anſwere, <hi>in your wings, and in the hemmes of your garments:</hi> that is to ſay, your offences are but too manifeſt. Now then we haue the Prophets meaning. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for this cauſe the particle <hi>yea euen,</hi> is to be noted dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently: for their cruelty was ſo much the more inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and deteſtable, in regard they roſe vp againſt thoſe that were ſent to cure their ſoules. For the Prophets were the miniſters of their ſaluation, as wee haue ſaid. Seeing then they ruſhed thus violently againſt that grace which God preſented vnto them, and therewithall ſlew his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: by this, one might the more eaſily iudge, that they were become vtterly incurable.</p>
                  <p>That which is forthwith added, makes for the further confirmation of his ſpeech: <hi>they were not found in fraction, or breaking.</hi> Some expound this place otherwiſe. But their opinion is probable who thinke the Prophet alludes to that which is ſpoken by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in Exod. 22.2. If any one were found making a breach, hee that ſlew him in doing the fact, ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed. For he that is ſo bold as to breake into another mans houſe, is like to him that robs by the hie-way ſide: ſuch an one therefore cannot
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7696:71"/> be held for a petty theefe, but rather for a common cut-throat that lurkes in hie-wayes. God then ſaith, that his Prophets whom the Iewes put to death, were not found forcibly breaking into houſes: that is to ſay, they were neither found guilty of felony, or murther (for he puts one kind for the generall) <hi>but they were vpon all theſe things:</hi> that is to ſay, in regard they boldly and freely reprooued you of your faults, becauſe they ſharply rebuked your wickedneſſes, and diſcouered your ſhame and filthineſſe; and becauſe they ſhewed themſelues enemies to all your iniquities, trecheries, and looſe behauiours. <hi>Thus then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prophets being prouoked by diuine inſpiration, ſtroue againſt your ſinnes; therefore you put them to death.</hi> We ſee the text runnes well thus, if it be only vnderſtood of the Prophets: and to ſay as the thing is, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> meant not only to reprooue the Iewes for the murthers they committed heere and there, but to ſhew how they were the deadly enemies of the Prophets, in regard they hated all holy and ſound admonitions, and were vncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any inſtruction. The errour of the other expoſitors is ſufficiently refuted; becauſe in the laſt member, they neither touch heauen nor earth, as they ſay. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet heere ſhewes how the Iewes were growne ſo ſhameleſſe, that it was impoſſible, by any admonitions whatſoeuer, to bring them to any bluſhing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7696:72"/> or moderate courſe. Albeit then they were like adulterous women, and ran like harlots into euery place, to get ſome reward: and although they alſo had ſlaine the Prophets, and holy ſeruants of God; yet, as if they had been no way culpable, they bragged (forſooth) of their <hi>innocency. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe</hi> then, <hi>you haue ſaid,</hi> that is to ſay, How dareſt thou pretend thou art any way innocent, ſeeing thou art conuinced, not onely by ſurmiſes or coniectures, but by ſo manifeſt and apparant demonſtrations? Moreouer, the Prophet ſhewes, that the eſtate and condition of the Iewes, was vtterly deſperate, ſeeing they would no more be admoniſhed: nay on the contrary, they were growne ſo obſtinate, that they <hi>durſt vaunt of their innocency. Thou hast ſaid:</hi> (note that he ſtill ſpeakes in the <hi>ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as to a wife) <hi>Thou haſt notwithſtanding ſaid, Surely I am cleane.</hi> See how hypocrites not onely labour with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers maskes, to excuſe themſelues; but more than that, are ſo bold, as to aduance themſelues, and houer in the ayre, as if by their confident pride they would ſcale euen the very heauens. As if they had ſaid, Who dare cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vs? Lo how hypocrites come in, loftily aduancing themſelues, in deſpiting and ſetting light by the ſeruants of God, thinking by their great crakes to put them to ſilence. Now he condemnes the Iewes of the like arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy; becauſe albeit they were manifeſtly conuinced, yet they feared not to affirme that they were altogether innocent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onely let him keepe backe his wrath from me.</hi> Behold yet another fault for which the Prophet reprocheth the Iewes; namely, becauſe they complained that God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them wrong, whileſt by his chaſtiſements and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions hee endeauoured to bring them into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> right way. For it is well knowne that God had already many wayes afflicted the Iewes: beſides, he had thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> added many ſharp and ſeuere reprehenſions. By which two meanes he prooued if hee might any way doe them good. But what did they? <hi>Surely I haue no way offended
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7696:72"/> him,</hi> but <hi>God is diſpleaſed againſt me without cauſe: onely let him withdraw his anger from me.</hi> As if they had ſaid, <hi>If ſo be God will not vſe his abſolute power againſt vs, and will not deale rigorouſly with vs, nor handle vs ſeuerely; it will be eaſie for vs to proue our innocency.</hi> See how the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked diſgorge their blaſphemies againſt God, when they feele themſelues throughly gauled with ſharpe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere admonitions, <hi>What ſhould I doe? I know I am not able to reſiſt: God fights but againſt a ſhadow, when hee afflicts me on this manner. I willingly beare, not onely all the aduerſities he layes vpon me, but wherewith hee preſſeth and perſecuteth me: yet therein he wrongs me. For if hee would proceed with me according to equity, I would be able to proue, that I haue not deſerued all the euils which hee hath brought vpon me.</hi> Thus the Iewes dealt with God. <hi>Onely let him withdraw his anger from vs, and then we ſhall make our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good; or at the leaſt we might be ſomewhat borne withall.</hi> Now we haue the Prophets meaning in this verſe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Iewes were growne bold and audacious, not onely by their curſed pride, in making a ſhew <hi>of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency;</hi> but alſo in that they durſt plead with God, <hi>as if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he had handled them too ſeuerely,</hi> by his prerogatiue roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and as if he meant not to call them to a iudicious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but proceeded againſt them rigorouſly, that ſo hee might ouerthrow and deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I will iudge thee, becauſe thou haſt ſaid, I haue not ſinned.</hi> Some tranſlate, I iudge, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. But queſtionleſſe there is heere a cloſe oppoſition betweene the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, and <hi>his iudgement.</hi> For the people complained, becauſe God vſed them too ſeuerely: the queſtion here then is, touching his <hi>wrath.</hi> Now God, he oppoſeth againſt that, <hi>his iudgement.</hi> You need not (ſaith he) pretend this excuſe; for in the end it will goe all into ſmoke, <hi>becauſe I will proceed in iuſtice againſt you:</hi> thar is, <hi>I will manifeſt it by the effects, that I am a iudge, and no tyrant,</hi> that I doe execute ſuch chaſtiſements as are due, and euery way agreeable to law: you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7696:73"/> are therefore to know, that I fare not like a furious man, who in his rage auengeth himſelfe vpon his enemies; yea and proceeds with them according to his blind and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate paſſions: but I will (ſaith hee) ſhew my ſelfe a iudge.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Hence we may gather a profitable inſtruction. And in the firſt place,<note place="margin">God cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure we ſhould iuſtifie our ſelues before him, when we be guilty:</note> let vs obſerue, that God abhorres nothing more, than this obſtinacy, when we will needs be reputed guiltleſſe, albeit our owne conſciences condemne vs. Let vs alſo in the ſecond place note, that all ſuch as aduance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> themſelues thus with this inſolencie and pride, and with an impudent obſtinacy,<note place="margin">For that is to ruſh againſt God.</note> not ſticking to vphold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their ſinnes; that they forthwith iuſtle againſt God. For all the falſe pretences which men alleage, come alwayes to this iſſue, namely, that God muſt thereby be condemned, as one that deales vniuſtly, and too ſeuerely. But will you ſee what ſuch kind of perſons get by this? <hi>God will in the end make it appeare to all the world, that hee is iudge: and thereby alſo will manifeſt the courſe he holds, in diſcouering and bringing to light, the wickedneſſe of thoſe, who thinke by ſhifts, cauils, and friuolous excuſes, to eſcape his iudgement ſeat.</hi> It muſt needs be then, that whoſoeuer rebelliouſly vſeth theſe practiſes againſt God, muſt at length come to that which the Prophet heere mentions: to wit, they ſhall be enforced, will they, nill they, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God neuer carried himſelfe rigorouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: neither that he vſed any vniuſt tyranny ouer them; but that they were chaſtiſed according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>

                        <hi>See verſ.</hi> 18.25.</note> But I haue already touched the Prophets meaning briefly. For
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7696:74"/> the Iewes no ſooner ſaw any danger approaching, but they ranne for refuge one while to Egypt, and another while to Aſſyria: and yet they knew that both the one, and the other was forbidden them:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16.</note> not that it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it ſelfe to ſeeke for helpe at the hands of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in time of extremity; but God meant to reſerue vnto himſelfe the whole praiſe of maintaining and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this people, ſo as no hurt could befall them, in regard hee had taken the defence of the Iewes into his owne hands. Seeing then that God had taken vpon him the ſafeguard of them; it was good reaſon they ſhould reſt themſelues content with his ſuccour? <hi>Whileſt they gazed heere and there then,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>and</hi> 15.14.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhewed a manifeſt ſigne of their diſtruſt: and ſo much as they attributed to the Egyptians, or to the Aſſyrians, ſo much they tooke from their God, who by his promiſe had bound himſelfe, that hee would take the care of their welfare and ſaluation.</hi> Thus then he compares ſuch gaddings to the lightneſſe of an harlot, when ſhee runnes too and fro. Now it muſt needs be, that an whore is growne paſt all ſhame, when ſhe goes thus about ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuſtomers, and entertaines him ſhe firſt lights vpon. For there are ſome harlots that tarry whileſt others ſeeke to them: but ſuch as offer themſelues to all commers, iuſtly deſerue to be deteſted of all. This is that which the Prophet meant then, namely when he ſaith, the Iewes ranne about, and that in ſuch ſort, as <hi>they changed their wayes:</hi> for euen in ſome immodeſt women, a man ſhall perceiue ſome natural ſhamefaſtneſſe to remaine in them: but if a woman, as ſoone as ſhe hath but caſt the glaunce of her eye vpon a man, doth by and by runne after him: or if a man, as ſoone as hee eſpies one but comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, ſhall be inflamed with luſt; it is a ſigne of more than a ſhameleſſe, brutiſh, yea a monſtrous filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. When one is growne to this paſſe then, it muſt needs thereupon follow, that they haue loſt all ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and haue put out in them the very light of nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Therefore (as I haue ſaid) it is good reaſon that ſuch
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7696:74"/> be held as monſters vpon earth, when men or women are thus carried away after whomſoeuer they ſet eye on. And yet with this the Prophet taxeth the Iewes, whileſt he tels them, <hi>they ranne about to change their wayes;</hi> ſo as their reſtleſſe luſt neuer ſtayed long in any place whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but they fell in loue with the firſt commers, yea and ran from place to place to ſeeke them out. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles this matter much more largely in many places; we ſhall alſo ſee the ſame ſimilitude repeated againe in this propheſie. But it ſufficeth that in few words I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Prophets meaning. Now he adds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt be confounded of Egypt, as thou hast been of Aſhur.</hi> For before <hi>Hezekias</hi> his time, the Iewes (as it is well knowne) had made a league with the Aſſyrians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of Syria, and the Iſraelites; and afterwards againſt the Egyptians. But after the Egyptians (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been their confederates) began to make warre againſt them, they changed their minds, and ſought to the Aſſyrians; and there they entred into a league with their ancient enemies: thus this ſecond couenant alſo ſtood them in no more ſtead than did the firſt: which is the cauſe why the Prophet tels them they ſhall haue the like ſucceſſe they had before. For God corrects their trechery and diſloyalty which they had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, in running to the Aſſyrians. Now he ſaith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, thy ſucceſſe ſhall bee no better in waiting for helpe from Egypt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which thou hadſt from Aſhur, when he came to ſuccour thee. For none can be ignorant, that the Iewes were ſtill euer and anon, expoſed as a prey to euery one; ſo as they receiued more loſſe by their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confederates, than by ſuch as were their open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies. And this was the iuſt reward of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and trechery.

                  <p>HE heere more plainly expreſſeth that which hee had ſaid touching the reproach of his nation; namely, that whileſt the Iewes thought to reſt vpon the aide of the Egyptians, they therby weaued the web of their own ruine. But this they beleeued not: for the Egyptians being their next neighbours, and the Iewes at that time feared no enemies but the Aſſyrians and Caldeans, who were farre remote from them, they imagined that their matters would ſucceed well, and be in great ſafety. How ſo? Our aduerſaries are twenty or thirty dayes iourney from vs; and our friends who are ready to ſuccour vs, are heere at our gates, as ſoone as they ſhall haue but the leaſt warning. The Iewes then (as I haue ſaid) thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues very ſecure: but the Prophet telles them here, that they are much deceiued. For, <hi>for this iniquity,</hi> that is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou truſtedſt in this ſo curſed a couenant,</hi> thereby promiſing ſafety to thy ſelfe, in regard of thine enemies; or rather becauſe thou imaginedſt thou mighteſt with little adoe ouercome them. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt go forth.</hi> And yet, was any thing more vnlikely, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, than that which the Prophet here tels them? For whileſt the Egyptians oppoſed themſelues againſt the Caldeans, they were to the Iewes, as a braſen wall ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, whereby they were (in a manner) inuincible: who would not haue thought the Iewes moſt ſafe in their owne countrey? <hi>Thou ſhalt goe forth</hi> then (ſaith he) <hi>and thine hands vpon thine head.</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7696:75"/> For if ſome impatient woman haue loſt her husband; or, if ſhe expect ſome great euill, ſhe beats on her breaſt, or ſpreads out her armes, as it is heere ſaid. <hi>Ieremiah then puts this geſture for a ſigne of exceeding ſorrow:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>This couenant vpon which the Iewes reſt with ſuch an inſolent boldneſſe, ſhall be ſo farre off from bringing profit or miniſtring comfort vnto them, that it ſhall rather be the cauſe of extreame affliction and reproach vnto them.</hi>

                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16.</note> the reaſon which followes is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Becauſe the Lord abhorres thy confidences, or prides.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the Prophet heere ſhewes the reaſon, why he ſpeakes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo bitterly to them. Becauſe a man indeed would haue thought this an exceſſiue manner of ſpeech, to compare this people vnto a common ſtrumpet, who fiskes abroad into euery corner. But this reaſon ſtood in ſtead of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, to take from them all ſhifts and euaſions; namely, that it was to no purpoſe for them to reſt vpon ſuch bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reeds, and deceiueable leaning ſtockes. Why ſo? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were accurſed of God.</hi> For had hee permitted them freely to haue vſed them, then had they not been ſo ſharply reprooued. But ſeeing God had forbidden them to goe downe into Egypt: this, in the firſt place, was an abominable confidence: ſecondly, it was a meanes to make them altogether careleſſe of Gods aſſiſtance; and (as you would ſay) to reiect all his promiſes. For in as much as their affections were faſt glued to the Egyptians, they alſo imagined, that in them, their ſafety was ſecure. By meanes whereof it came to paſſe, that their prayers were not onely few, and faint, but they ſcarcely ſo much as vſed any at all. Thus we ſee how the Prophet paſſeth not his bounds heere in this his vehement reprehenſion vttered againſt the Iewes, in ſetting <hi>ſhame and ignominie</hi> before their eyes: namely, becauſe they gaue that glory to the Egyptians, which appertained vnto God; making their account as if they had been the authors of their ſafety: and thereby alſo they buried in obliuion, yea contemned all the promiſes of God, and vtterly neglected
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7696:76"/> inuocation vpon his name. <hi>The Lord</hi> then (ſaith he) <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors thy confidences.</hi>

                  <p>In the next place he ſaith, <hi>Neither ſhalt thou proſper thereby.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No good can come of that action, that God approoues not.</note> This muſt bee diligently obſerued, namely, that when we take ought in hand which God approoues not, that no good can come vnto vs thereby. Why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will fruſtrate all our hopes. Let vs know then that the Prophet ſets a puniſhment before all vnbeleeuers, who not contenting themſelues with Gods protection, wander in their vaine and idle confidences; and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enioy the fauour and good liking of men, than the fauour and loue of God.

For the Prophet brings not in God ſpeaking heere; but hee comes in with a common ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Put the caſe that a man put away his wife, and ſhe become another mans, ſhall ſhe returne againe to the firſt? No; for this is not the cuſtome. I therefore will ſhew my ſelfe more fauourable than any man whatſoeuer: for I will be most ready to take thee againe: prouided, thou promiſe me for the time to come, to carry thy ſelfe as an honeſt woman ought to doe:</hi> to wit, <hi>loyally towards me, in renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all thy former looſe and lewd behauiour.</hi> You ſee there is no great difficulty in that which the Prophet meant to ſay, nor in the ſumme of his ſpeech. For God here ſhewes that his wrath ſhall be appeaſed towards the Iewes, if ſo be they proceed not on ſtill in their vngodlineſſe, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and rebelliouſly. And the better to expreſſe this his clemency, he vſeth a ſimilitude, which ought adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly to be noted. Before, he ſaid, that hee held the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of an husband; and that this people was vnto him in his account, as a wife, chap. 2.2. In the next place he bewailes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their grieuous ingratitude and diſloyalty, in that they had thus forſaken him; telling them it was all one, as if a wife forſaking her husband, ſhould proſtitute her ſelfe to all commers. Heere he adds, <hi>Behold, if an husband put away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his wife, and ſhe marry with another, he would neuer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch a wife againe into his fauour:</hi> for hee was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſo to doe, by the Law. <hi>But ſee how ready I am not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, to take thee againe;</hi> albeit the diuorce came not as in reſpect of my fault. For it was the cuſtome of the husbands then, to put away their wiues, when there appeared in them any cauſe of diſlike. It is not a ſimple compariſon, as many thinke, (neither doe I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all follow this opinion) for the expoſitors doe not ſo much as touch this expoſition: becauſe God doth not ſimply heere compare himſelfe with an husband that hath put away his wife for her lewdneſſe: but as I haue ſaid, there are two diſtinct members, in regard the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7696:77"/> Iewes were wont to caſhere their wiues for very light cauſes; yea for ſuch as were of no moment at all. Now God ſpeakes thus in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Shew me your bill of diuorce:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I haue not put away your mother. For at that time, when any purpoſed to put away his wife, he was liable by the law, to the note of ſome fickleneſſe. For what (I pray you) was that bill of diuorcement, but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the wiues chaſtity? otherwiſe, if the woman had been taken in adultery, the husband needed not to ſend her away, for ſhee was to ſuffer death. Thus then, <hi>adulterous women vſed not to be diuorced.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1.</note> But if a mans wife had liued honeſtly with her husband, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he meant to put her away, hee was bound by the law to giue her a bill of diuorce, on this manner: <hi>I put away this woman, not for breaking or violating the marriage band; but becauſe her perſonage, or qualities are not to my liking.</hi> Thus the husbands were obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre ſome note of inconſtancy; and therefore it is that the Lord ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah, Shew me the bill of your mothers diuorce:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, it is ſhee her ſelfe that hath caſt me off: it is ſhe, who by her whoredomes hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſacred bond of marriage: it is not I then, that am the cauſe of this alienation. God meant not heere then to ſignifie that he diuorced the people; for that was a thing worthy of blame, and therefore could not agree with Gods nature: but (as I ſaid) there is a double ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or compariſon. <hi>Albeit an husband in his diſcontent had reiected his wife; and that by meanes thereof (by his owne fault) he occaſions her to marry another: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, after a ſecond hath lien with her, becauſe hee thinkes he is now deſpiſed, he eſteemes it ſo great an indignity, that he will neuer admit of any reconciliation. But I thinke you will not ſay that I haue ſent you away: you rather haue played the part of a diſloyall wife, hauing proſtituted your ſelues to the firſt commers; yet am I ready notwithſtanding to receiue you into fauour, and to forget all your former ſlips and falles.</hi> Now we haue the ſumme of that which the Prophet meant to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7696:77"/> ſay heere. And in this ſecond member there is a <hi>compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the leſſe to the greater.</hi> For the agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t would be more eaſily effected, if the wife hauing been reiected by her husband, ſhould afterward come to pleaſe him, and recouer his fauour, albeit ſhe had married another: but when an adulterous wife finds her husband ſo willing and ready to pardon her; it is a very rare example, and hardly ſhall it be diſcerned in any one. We ſee then, how our Lord magnifies his mercy towards this people, by an argument taken from the leſſe to the greater: which he the rather doth, that the Iewes might be ſo much the more without excuſe, in that they had ſo obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected ſo great a fauour which God freely offered them.</p>
                  <p>But heere a queſtion may be asked, namely, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> wherefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That this land is polluted with pollutions,</hi> or, <hi>in this?</hi> I will in the firſt place ſpeake of the words, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> and afterwards I will diſpatch the reſt. All in (a manner) turne it thus; <hi>Hath not this land been polluted with pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> But in reading this place thus, I know not what ſenſe to draw from it, vnleſſe peraduenture God meant to compare the wife diuorced, to the land: or rather, that ſuddenly breaking off his ſpeech, hee meant to transferre that which he had ſaid touching the reiected wife, to the land: or at leaſt, that hee now expounds the figure which he formerly vſed. And yet wee may take it in this ſenſe, reading it apart thus, <hi>In this,</hi> to wit, if it ſo fall out, that ſome one take her for his wife the ſecond time, who had married another. For (as we haue ſhewed) this was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the law: neither could it bee auoided, but the husband of ſuch a wife muſt be reputed an adulterer, if he tooke her againe for his wife, whom he had once put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. For by the bill of diuorce, the woman was at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: not that God permitted it ſo to be; but becauſe the women were guiltleſſe, they were borne withall: for God laid all the fault vpon the husbands. Now in this caſe, when the wife who had been diuorced from her firſt husband, ioyned her ſelfe in marriage with another, this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7696:78"/> ſecond marrying was lawfull; ſo as if the firſt husband would recouer his wife whom he had forſaken, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in violated and brake the faith of the ſecond marriage. And in this ſenſe it is the Prophet ſaith, that <hi>in this,</hi> the land ſhall be polluted: as if he would haue ſaid, It is not lawfull for the husband to recall his wife to him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he be moſt ready to entertaine her into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and good liking: and yet doe I (ſaith the Lord) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing elſe, <hi>but that you ſhould returne vnto me.</hi> As touching theſe words, we haue already ſeene how the Prophet ſaith not without cauſe, <hi>In this,</hi> that is to ſay, it would breed ſuch confuſion, if a woman ſhould bee married now to this man, and then to another; and in concluſion, ſhould returne againe to the firſt: that by meanes heereof the band of humane ſociety and order would be broken. Moreouer, by meanes heereof the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred band of matrimony would be violated, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is one of the moſt principall bands that men haue, to preſerue and eſtabliſh the right gouernment of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>When he adds, <hi>but thou haſt played the harlot with many louers,</hi> it is the better to confirme that which wee haue ſeene before; namely, that the people offended not in <hi>one thing alone,</hi> but were growne like common ſtrumpets, who indifferently, without any choyce at all, proſtitute themſelues to the firſt cuſtomer; which is ſignified by theſe words, <hi>many louers;</hi> that is with many whore-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: for he calles them companions, or louers, who ſeeme to ſue to one woman.</p>
                  <p>Then he adds, <hi>yet turne againe vnto me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> that is, I am moſt ready to receiue thee to mercy, if ſo be thou wilt confeſſe thy fault. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> But heere may ariſe a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; namely, how God promiſeth to doe that, which himſelfe in his Law had forbidden to be done? But the ſolution is eaſie. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> I grant, that ſo farre forth as reſpect was to be had to the right of maintaining humane ſociety, there was no other remedie to be giuen: but ſeeing men
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7696:78"/> had this liberty to put away their wiues, it was not freely to be permitted without ſome reſtraint, leſt ſo it might ſeeme that God meant to cheriſh and approoue of their lightneſſe and inconſtancy. It was very requiſite then, that wayward and peeuiſh husbands ſhould be thus cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed, that it might at no hand be lawfull for them to take againe into their fellowſhip, the wife whom they had once put away: otherwiſe euery one would haue been ready to haue changed their minds euery third day, or at leaſt, euery yeere: and then would haue been as ready (the fit being ouer) to haue demanded her againe. God himſelfe therefore impoſed this law vpon diuorces; that the man who had once put away his wife, might not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward receiue her againe. But the caſe is otherwiſe in reſpect of God: therefore no wonder if he retaine this right and power of receiuing the Iewes againe into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, vpon their amendment.

For we haue ſeene before, and ſhall haue occaſion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7696:79"/> oft times in this propheſie to repeat the ſame thing, that God in his ſight eſteemed ſuperſtitions as ſo many adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. Now it was an vſuall thing with the Iewes to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp to the tops of mountaines; as if there forſooth, they had been nearer vnto God. And this is the reaſon why the Prophet wils them <hi>to lift their eyes vnto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if there be any hillocke which is not infected with thy whoredomes.</hi> For euen as lewd perſons ſeeke for places that are cloſe, to commit their filthineſſe in; ſo alſo the hils ſerued the Iewes for their dens and brothell-houſes. For which cauſe alſo their impiety was ſo much the more execrable, in that they ſtucke not to proclaime to all the world what they were: as if they meant to diſcouer their villanies vpon an open theater: whereas harlots are wont to goe into corners, when they haue found their companions. Thus then, the prophet takes from them heere all occaſions of cauelling, when he bids them lift vp their eyes to the high places: for in bowing before their idols, it was all one as if an harlot had proſtituted her body to the accompliſhment of her luſt: and he adds, they <hi>ſate waiting vpon the wayes, as the Arabian in the wilderneſſe.</hi> Heere he repeates that which we haue ſeene before; namely, that the Iewes were not ſuddenly ouertaken by the allurements and enticements of others, to falſifie the faith of marriage which they had vowed to God; but that they were pricked forward by their owne inordinate luſts, to ſeeke out impudent and filthy louers. And becauſe he had ſaid, thou haſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others by thy malice; therefore now alſo he confirms the ſame,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.33.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſitteſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vpon all wayes.</hi> Which ſpeech alſo agrees to filthy harlots, who (as hath been ſaid) are paſt ſhame.</p>
                  <p>But the Prophet amplifies this fault by another ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: <hi>euen</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the Arabian waits for paſſengers in the wilderneſſe,</hi> to rob and cut their throats: ſo thou alſo ſeemeſt in like manner to ſit in all thy wayes. We ſee here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is a double ſimilitude then: the firſt taken from <hi>harlots,</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:7696:79"/> long exerciſed in that trade, who ſeeing themſelues neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, lurke in paſſages, and ſhameleſly inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> into mens acquaintance; and without any choyce, ſeaze vpon him that comes firſt. This is one of the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes. The ſecond is, that they behaued themſelues in a manner, like cut-throats, who watch for paſſengers: as if he had ſaid, The Chaldeans and Egyptians are blameleſſe (as it were) being compared with the Iewes. Why ſo? Becauſe the Iewes allured them to become their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and drew them into their wicked and curſed coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants by artificiall wiles. As if a paſſenger falling into theeues hands, by little and little they ſhould corrupt him. As how? Alas! thou art but a poore ſnake; but if thou wilt come and make a couenant with vs, and be our companion; there is certaine hope of good ſucceſſe, and that euery day will furniſh vs with new booties: are not ſuch old theeues (trow yee) thriſe, yea foure times worſe than this new ſcholer? Likewiſe alſo the prophet ſaith, the Iewes were all become like old experienced theeues, hardened in their myſtery of ambuſhments, robberies, ſpoylings, and all ſorts of lewd practices; and had now drawne the Aſſyrians and Egyptians into their ſocietie.

Now hee lets vs ſee how farre they were ſunk in an vntamed rebellion. <hi>The ſhowers haue been reſtrained</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they haue not fallen in their latter ſeaſon: and yet hadst thou for all that an whores fore-head; thou wouldeſt not bluſh, nor be aſhamed:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, there was no iudgement that could tame thee. The fault
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7696:80"/> was too great already, whileſt the Prophets cried daily vpon them, to bring them home into the right way, by their holy admonitions: and yet they regarded not. In that they were become ſuch dullards then, as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ought that the Prophets vttered, it was one ſigne of their wickedneſſe. But beſides this, God had endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to draw them to him by ſeuere chaſtiſements which he inflicted vpon them; hee had cauſed the earth (to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their ſinnes) to become vnfruitful: neither is it to be doubted, but this <hi>drought</hi> whereof the Prophet ſpeakes, was ſo extraordinary, that the Iewes might well perceiue (if there had been in them but a dramme of true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) that they had prouoked Gods wrath againſt them.

According to this ſenſe hee demands, <hi>whether they will not yet once againe call vpon him, as their father, and as the guide of their youth?</hi> Now by this manner of ſpeech he ſignifies, that he <hi>was married with this people.</hi> For the affection which the husband beares to a young virgin, in the flower of her youth, is maruellous tender. And this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7696:81"/> ſimilitude God vſeth in this place, ſaying, I cannot yet forget that exceeding loue which I bare to this my Church and people. In a word, I am ready to pardon them, if ſo be they ſeeke peace and amity with me: which he confirmes in the next verſe, ſaying:</p>

                  <p>GOd heere ſhewes, that it is the Iewes fault that hee receiues them not to mercy: And this he doth by an argument taken from his owne nature. Now hee ſpeakes of himſelfe in the third perſon: and it is all one as if the Prophet had reaſoned thus: God is not ſuch an one as cannot be entreated; for hee is alwayes as ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, as he is patient and long-ſuffering: who lets you then, that you liue not happily vnder his rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion? For he will ſpare you, if ſo be he finde you truly penitent. Wee ſee now what the Prophet meant to ſay. For God hauing exhorted and allured them graciouſly to repentance; the Prophet now in generall ſets foorth the nature of God, namely, <hi>that he keepes not his anger for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, neither doth he alwayes nouriſh the memory of it.</hi> When theſe words are put ſimply by themſelues; they ſignifie, to nouriſh vengeance in the heart. In our tongue, we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this Hebrew phraſe, He keepes it. When this word,<note place="margin">Illui garde.</note> 
                     <hi>To keepe,</hi> is put ſimply, without an other word ioyned with it, it ſignifies (as I haue ſaid) to nouriſh that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which a man hath in his heart. Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more repugnant to this, than Gods nature: whence it followes, that nothing hinders the Iewes from obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fauour, but their owne backwardneſſe and vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe: and as they are maliciouſly bent to their will, ſo will they not receiue that pardon and grace which is freely offered and preſented before them.</p>
                  <p>As touching that which afterwards followes, it may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7696:82"/> be expounded two wayes: for it may be taken thus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou haſt ſpoken it, and done it: as if the Lord ſhould ſay, I ceaſe not to ſhew my ſelfe fauourable and mercifull vnto you, bee the faults you haue committed neuer ſo many and great. But there is another expoſition which ſeemes to be more naturall and agreeable; namely, that God heere takes vp a lamentation, in reſpect he ſees there is no hope to be conceiued of the Iewes amendment, in regard they are growne hardened in their euill wayes. <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and done it, and haſt had abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to doe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet there are ſundry opinions among the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as touching theſe latter words. Some take this, And haſt had ability; for, according as thou haſt had ability; or, according to the power thou haſt had: as if he ſhould ſay, ſo farre forth as thy ability ſtretched, thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all ſorts of wickedneſſes. Others take it more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and (as I thinke) their opinion is the beſt: Thou haſt been powerfull: that is thou haſt wholly giuen ouer thy ſelfe to wickedneſſe, euen according to the vttermoſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of thy power. Thus then I vnderſtand it. After God had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſhewed himſelfe ſorry for their miſeries, and had louingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> exhorted them to repentance, teſtifying that he would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ready to make peace with them, in regard he is by nature enclined to ſhew mercy: after the manifeſtation of all theſe things, he now adds, <hi>Behold, this people are become deſperate and paſt hope of recouery:</hi> namely, <hi>becauſe they boaſted of their wickedneſſe.</hi> For, <hi>to ſpeake, and doe,</hi> is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>This people are become ſo impudent, that they ſticke not to call darkneſſe light:</hi> as wee know it is the manner of the ſuperſtitious to bee ſo ſhameleſſe, that they feare not to braue God to his face. Now ſuch was the quality and condition of this people: that indeed which God principally condemned in them by the mouthes of his Prophets, was that they corrupted his pure worſhip commanded in his Law. But they on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (like brazen-faced ſtrumpets) were ſo malepert, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7696:82"/> againſt that, to alleage their owne deuotions and good intentions, as they commonly called them. Seeing then they were growne ſo audacious, as to maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their bad courſes, God heere complaines, <hi>that there is no hope of their amendment:</hi> and therefore giues them ouer as graceleſſe and deſperate people. This is it which I conceiue touching the true and naturall meaning of this place. And to the ſame purpoſe he alſo adds, <hi>thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>waſt able:</hi> that is, thou ceaſedſt not to adde ſinne to ſinne, but gaueſt thy ſelfe ouer to the committing of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

                  <p>HEre the Prophet begins a new ſpeech: for he recites that which God had giuen him in charge; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notes <hi>the time;</hi> to wit, <hi>whileſt Ioſias raigned.</hi> Now it is well knowne, that in his dayes the land was purged from all ſorts of ſuperſtitions. For this good King endeauored to reſtore Gods pure worſhip, and to aboliſh all the filthy corruptions wherewith the Temple, and religion it ſelfe had been wholly infected and defiled. He therefore man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imployed himſelfe in this buſineſſe; neither is it to be doubted, but as touching the outward face of things,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7696:83"/> religion and piety then ſeemed to flouriſh: yet ſhall we ſee how in the greater part of the people, hypocriſie and counterfait holineſſe beare a great ſway: which often falls out, when the heads and gouernours of countreys deſire to maintaine the purity of Gods worſhip, and to purge out the corruptions that haue crept in. For ye ſhall euer ſee ſome which carry a faire ſhew for a time; and yet in the meane while, will not ſticke to continue ſtill in their obſtinacy againſt God. This was then the ſtate of the Commons. Which we are diligently to obſerue: becauſe it might be thought that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> carried himſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too harſhly towards his nation: for reformation was in euery mans mouth: as the greater part of thoſe at this day, who at the beginning of reformation, made goodly ſhewes of their readineſſe to embrace the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell: and yet after they had renounced all popiſh ſuperſtitions, now willingly content themſelues with a ſlight reformation, wherein they glory. But in the meane while they ſhift off Chriſts yoke, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be ſubiect to the diſcipline of the Church. In a word, they could wiſh that all order and policy were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne. And yet for all this, as oft as they are taxed for their ſinnes, they are ready to couer themſelues with this faire pretext of reformation. And doubtleſſe <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> had euen ſuch in his time to deale withall. This is the cauſe why he expreſlly notes, <hi>that he had this commiſſion in the dayes of Ioſias:</hi> to wit, euen then whileſt the King bent himſelfe to ſet vp Gods worſhip in the purity of it; and whileſt none durſt contradict it: for during this time wee may perceiue, that God was called vpon with one conſent, without any outward ſuperſtitions.</p>
                  <p>But what is the ſumme of this meſſage or ambaſſage? <hi>Hast thou not ſeene</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what this diſdainfull Iſrael hath done?</hi> God heere compares the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> with <hi>the kingdome of Iudah:</hi> to which (as we know) was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded halfe the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin:</hi> hee compares <hi>Iſrael</hi> then with <hi>Iudah,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Seeſt thou not what this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7696:83"/> Iſrael hath done?</hi> Now he brings in the <hi>kingdome of Iſrael and Iudah,</hi> vnder the perſon <hi>of a wife.</hi> For as we haue ſeene heretofore, God takes vnto himſelfe the perſon of <hi>an husband,</hi> in reſpect of the people.<note place="margin">

For albeit the Iſraelites had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from God, yet had he not vtterly reiected them: ſo the couenant held as yet in part. In this ſenſe hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, <hi>as well Iſrael as Iudah, for his wiues.</hi> Hee ſaith then, <hi>Haſt thou not ſeene what this diſdainfull Iſrael hath done?</hi> This word, <hi>To diſdaine,</hi> or turne away, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly taken by the expoſitors; but it may properly bee tranſlated, <hi>lewd,</hi> or looſe.<note place="margin">Desbauchée.</note>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7696:84"/> me, in reuolting from me, and in forſaking their faith, and and all piety. But I rather encline to the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: namely, that God heere ſhewes how his purpoſe was to recall and bring backe the ten Tribes, by his ſeruants the Prophets; notwithſtanding they prouoked him to wrath and iealouſie. Thus then God meant heere to ſhew how the Iſraelites were bent to obſtinacy and rebellion; for he did but looſe his labour, though hee tooke ſuch paines by all good meanes to bring them home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. I take this word <hi>ſaid</hi> then, for the Prophets do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Although the Iſraelites were plunged (as it were) ouer head and eares in their impieties; yet left I no meanes vnattempted for all that, to ſee if I could cauſe them to returne vnto me.</hi> In a word, he ſhewes how he reſembled not thoſe husbands which could neuer be brought in any ſort to be reconciled with their wiues, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue been prouoked to ielouſie, by the diſgraces, and wicked outrages which haue been offered them. God hereby ſhewes then, that albeit the Iſraelites had forſaken him, yet he ſent them his Prophets; yea, and himſelfe alſo ſought which way he might be at one with them: but they neuer returned.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he adds, <hi>And when ſhee ſaw vpon all this,</hi> to wit, <hi>for all the whoredomes that rebellious Iſrael committed:</hi> that is to ſay, when <hi>the kingdome of Iudah</hi> ſaw all theſe things. We ſhall ſee the drift of this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon by and by. For he amplifies the wickedneſſe of the kingdome of Iudah, becauſe ſhe might eaſily behold all that which hath formerly been recited; yea, and a great way off, as from an high turret diſcerne it; and ſo might haue been brought to repentance: but <hi>ſhe ſaw,</hi> howbeit without fruit. Thus then God meant to ſhew what obſtinacy there was in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who had beheld the reuolt of the ten Tribes: neither were they ignorant how ſharply they had been reproued and threatened by the Prophets.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.</note>And in the next verſe he adds, <hi>I haue ſeene.</hi> As in the

                     </label> But heere a queſtion may be asked, How is it ſaid, he gaue Iſrael a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce; ſeeing in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 50. verſ. 1. he flatly denies it? But the Prophet ſpeakes heere in another ſenſe, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> than hee doth in that place of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> For hee mentions not heere that bill of diuorce which husbands were wont to giue their wiues, when they meant to put them away; who in other reſpects had carried themſelues chaſtly and well: but he ſpeakes of ſuch a diuorce as was approued of by the Law; to wit, when the woman being conuinced of adultery was condemned to death. God therfore in <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> denies that he had giuen any bill of diuorce; and yet heere he ſaith <hi>he gaue one:</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe he had put away a wife taken in adultery.</hi> I grant this was not ordinarily practiced among the Iewes at that time; namely, that a man being diuorced himſelfe from an adulterous wife, ſhe was by and by called to iudgement. But wee haue ſeene in the beginning of this Chapter, what difference there is betweene God, and womens husbands. For as much then as God had not dealt rigorouſly with the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7696:85"/> neither had inflicted vpon them thoſe extreame puniſhments which they had iuſtly deſerued, and alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome then in vſe; therefore he ſaith, <hi>hee gaue her a bill of diuorce;</hi> that is to ſay, he ſeparated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from this people, and vtterly forſooke them. In the meane while <hi>by the bill of diuorce,</hi> he vnderſtands <hi>their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What is meant by diuorce in this place.</note> For when the ten Tribes were led into captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was all one as if God had openly proteſted that hee would no longer hold his couenant or coniunction at all with this people. Truly, whileſt they dwelt in the holy land, and in the inheritance which he had promiſed them, there remained alwayes ſome reſemblance of this holy wedlock: but after they were once ſcattered heere and there, and that Gods true worſhip had no more any place among them: in a word, after the name of the kingdome of Iſraell was once aboliſhed, then God made this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Her ſiſter Iudah</hi> then, <hi>ſaw,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and yet ſhee feared not.</hi> Now what an exceeding great ſenſeleſneſſe was this, not to become wiſe by the harmes of another? But this complaint is often met withall in the Prophets, namely, that when God ſpared the Iewes, they were neuer moued thereby to repentance, albeit God ſet ſuch examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, as might haue been ſufficient to haue ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified them. For might they not well thinke (or at leaſt they ought ſo to haue done) that God would certainly ſhew himſelfe their Iudge, in puniſhing ſo many crimes whereby they had prouoked him, ſeeing hee ſpared not (the Iſraelites) their brethren? They ſaw that poore king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, rooted out and aboliſhed, before their eyes: and yet they came all out of one and the ſame ſtocke, to wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was father to them both. How was it poſſible then, that they ſhould make ſo little reckoning of Gods iudgements, which had ſo long a time been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed vpon their brethren in their ſight?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Prophet hath ſhewed how the Tribe of Iudah deſerued to bee more ſeuerely puniſhed than the ten Tribes, and alſo added the reaſon of it; to wit, becauſe they ſaw before their eyes what chaſtiſements had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon them; and yet without any remorſe as on their parts: hee now directs his ſpeech <hi>to the Iſraelites</hi> themſelues, <hi>or to the ten Tribes; and promiſeth that God will now be mercifull vnto them, and bow his eares to their prayers.</hi> The kingdome of Iſrael at this time was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and the people thereof led captiue; ſome of them into Aſſyria, and ſome of them among thoſe of the Medes and Perſians; ſo as they were in ſuch wiſe diſperſed, that no memory at all was left of that kingdome. As touching the countrey, it had often been waſted before. For from the beginning, there yet remained ſome part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; in regard foure Tribes onely were carried away into captiuity: but in the end, the memory of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was vtterly aboliſhed, and (as I haue ſaid) led into captiuity. See why the Prophet then is commanded to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7696:88"/> direct his ſpeech <hi>towards the North.</hi> For albeit the moſt of them were then in the Eaſt; yet God chiefly reſpects that place which was the moſt eminent in all the Empire, in regard they had been waſted by the Aſſyrians. This is the cauſe why the Lord bids his Prophet <hi>cry theſe words</hi> to them whom the enemy had carried into the North parts.<note place="margin">Reaſons why the Prophet was commanded to cry.</note> 
                     <hi>Cry</hi> then (ſaith he) not onely <hi>becauſe the diſtance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> place was very great;</hi> but alſo in regard <hi>the Iſraelites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who now were become deafe, might heare and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words.</hi> Moreouer, the Prophet had not this charge giuen him onely in reſpect of the Iſraelites; but in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their example he ſets the mercy of God alſo before the Iewes, if ſo be they would returne. The ſumme is this, <hi>that although the Iſraelites had been rebellious,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>and had eſtranged themſelues from God; yet they might now obtaine pardon if they would conuert.</hi> We told you before (in a word) what the Prophet meanes by this word <hi>conuerſion,</hi> or returning, and we ſhall alſo haue occaſion to mention it againe in another place. <hi>He would they ſhould repent then,</hi> promiſing, that if they ſo doe, they ſhall find God fauourable vnto them.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he adds, <hi>I will not cauſe my face to fall,</hi> or my wrath, <hi>vpon you:</hi> and this latter expoſition agrees beſt. God had ſeuerely chaſtiſed their ſinnes already: for what greater euill could befall them, than to bee expulſed the land of their natiuity, and to be ſubiect to ſuch cruell tyrants? But that which was worſt of all, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of Gods pure worſhip, which himſelfe had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Law, they were reiected of God himſelfe: they had loſt that glory and prerogatiue, whereby they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues more excellent than any people in the world beſides. For they were choſen indeed to bee his peculiar people: but now all this was gone. How is it then, that God ſaith, <hi>he will no more let his wrath fall vpon them?</hi> The Prophet ſimply meanes by this manner of ſpeech, <hi>that God will not be vnreconciliable:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>My wrath ſhall not continue;</hi> or, <hi>it ſhall not alwayes fall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7696:88"/> heauie vpon you; but I will moderate the afflictions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I haue exerciſed you.</hi> I therefore miſlike not Saint <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> tranſlation [I will not ſtay] albeit he vſeth this word, To make; which yet (as I haue ſaid) doth not ſufficiently expreſſe the Prophets meaning. But this will bee a good expoſition, if we reade, <hi>I will not let my wrath reſt vpon you:</hi> that is to ſay, My wrath ſhall not tary or abide; or, it ſhall not lie heauie vpon your heads, vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme you. <hi>The wrath of God I grant was already fallen vpon them; yet ſo, that they were not left hopeleſſe of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</hi> God then ſaith, that the plagues which hee had brought vpon them for their ſinnes, ſhould not be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Why ſo? Becauſe he would withdraw his hand, and not proſecute them to the vttermoſt with extremity. The ſumme is, <hi>That if the people ſhall returne vnto God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſumme.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhall obtaine fauour, in regard God is mooued of his owne good pleaſure to call them to himſelfe, and promiſeth that the iudgement he hath ſent vpon them ſhall laſt but for a while.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And God once againe confirmes this doctrine, <hi>from an argument taken from his owne nature: For I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>am mercifull; neither will I retaine my wrath for euer.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was particular in reſpect of the peoples returne out of captiuity: now that he might confirme the ſame, hee adds a generall doctrine, namely, <hi>That he is enclined to mercy:</hi> and according as he is wholly bent thereunto, ſo will he eaſily be drawne to forgiue. <hi>Seeing God then is ſuch an one, and therefore cannot deny himſelfe; what cauſe haue ſinners to deſpaire, thereby ſhutting vp the gate (as it were) againſt themſelues, from hauing any acceſſe at all to Gods mercy?</hi>

Therefore when the Prophets goe about to exhort the Iewes to repentance, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>ſet their ſinnes before them.</hi> Were there any ſhame, or good nature in men, they needed not to bee thus preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but in regard they are either impudent, and ſo will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> neuer confeſſe their faults; or ſo ſenſeleſſe, that nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> can terrifie them: therefore it is needfull they ſhould bee thus ſharply gauled; yea deeply wounded. This courſe the Prophet takes heere. <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>carried thy ſelfe wickedly towards thy God:</hi> as if the Prophet ſhould haue ſaid, It is not without cauſe, that in this particular manner I admoniſh thee to acknowledge thy faults: for it is God himſelfe that condemnes thee; thinke not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thy euaſions can doe thee any good.</p>
                  <p>In the next place (to preſſe them yet nearer to the quicke) he adds <hi>the kind of fault</hi> wherein they failed,<note place="margin">From the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet proceds to charge them with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</note>

He ſpeakes modeſtly of an immodeſt action, when he ſaith, <hi>thou haſt ſcattered thy wayes:</hi> but by theſe words he ſignifies, that they ſatisfied not themſelues with one kind of ſuperſtition, or with one idoll, but polluted themſelues with <hi>ſundry ſuperſtitions;</hi> and that on euery ſide they heaped together diuers deceitfull errours; euen
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7696:90"/> as a common harlot proſtitutes her ſelfe to ſuch as ſhee neuer knew before, without any choyce at all.</p>

And wee know nothing is more vſuall, than for thoſe that forſake the true ſeruice of God, to gather to themſelues, from all parts, ſundry deceits and errours, ſo as they proſtitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without any reſtraint, before all ſorts of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place he adds, <hi>and thou haſt not heard my voice.</hi> By this circumſtance the Prophet amplifies their offence; namely, that hauing <hi>been inſtructed</hi> by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Law, and therefore could not be ignorant of the right way to ſaluation: how was it poſſible they ſhould thus foully corrupt themſelues, by entertaining ſuch variety of ſuperſtitions? They could not ſay, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was the cauſe of it: it was their open rebellion then againſt God. Thus the Prophet ſhewes they were diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and had no ſtay of themſelues at all: and that hence came their falling away into idolatry and peruerſe errours;<note place="margin">The ſumme and ſcope of the whole <hi>12.</hi> and <hi>13.</hi> verſes.</note> namely, <hi>they had ſhaken off Gods yoke, and would not endure to be gouerned by his word.</hi> Now wee haue the ſumme and ſcope of all theſe words. In the firſt place God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wils the Iſraelites <hi>to confeſſe their ſinnes:</hi> which if they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> performe, he ſhewes <hi>what gaine they ſhall get by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 12.</note> which he mentioned erewhile. For, till the ſinner acknowledge his faults, he will neuer become a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert,<note place="margin">Note.</note> neither will he from his heart turne vnto God. The beginning of repentance therfore, is to acknowledge and confeſſe our ſinnes. Moreouer, hee conuinceth them of their ſinnes, that he might take from them all occaſions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> cauelling. Thirdly, <hi>he names the kind of ſinne,</hi> that hee might hold them (as it were) at a bay: to wit, that they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7696:90"/> were defiled with ſuperſtitions. And moreouer he adds, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that they were not onely like to an adultereſſe, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes another husband, <hi>but to the filthy of-ſcums of the world,</hi> who poſt hither and thither, without reſpect either of thoſe they know, or know not. Laſtly he ſhewes, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> this came to paſſe <hi>meerly by their owne rebellion;</hi> namely, becauſe they had wholly ſhaken off all feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God, in regard he had committed to their cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>the oracles of his Law:</hi> beſides, they had alſo <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> whom he had ſent to be the true expoſitors thereof. They were therefore ſufficiently taught and inſtructed in that which concerned the will of God; and alſo how to haue walked in the right way. Whence came it then, that they ſo groſly erred? <hi>They ſtopped their eares</hi> againſt that word of God which was preached vnto them, and would not endure to bee guided and gouerned by the ſame, but grew vtterly vnteachable.

This fauour of God is not to be a little admired: who albeit his grace be (in a manner) neglected, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of men by their ſlothfulneſſe, yet ceaſeth hee not;

For after the Latines, this domination is referred to the husband, who is the wiues head.

                     </note> and perſiſts in the ſame ſimilitude of marriage, often mentioned before. For he accuſed the Iſraelites of adulteries, in regard they had forſaken him: which is the cauſe he now adds, <hi>And yet I am your husband.</hi> He ſaid before, that if any man had put away his wife, and that ſhee ſhould marry another, the firſt would neuer after be reconciled to her: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I willingly forgiue all your diſloyalty and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; onely hereafter carry your ſelues chaſtly towards me, and you ſhall finde that I alſo will keepe my faith with you.

                     </note> that is to ſay, Albeit I haue put you away. For hee told them before, that hee gaue them a bill of diuorce,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7696:91"/> that is, he had (as it were) by a publike and autenticke inſtrument teſtified, that he had caſt them off, and that he neuer meant afterwards to be ioyned vnto them againe in any couenant: for their exile was a kind of diuorce. Now he ſaith, <hi>I am your husband:</hi> for howſoeuer you haue by the breach of your faith, much offended me, yet doe I ſtill continue my firſt plea, <hi>I am your husband.</hi> We now vnderſtand the Prophets drift and meaning: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Iſraelites might haue bin ſo foreſtalled with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, that they would vtterly haue diſtaſted this fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceſſe, whereunto the Prophet calles and exhorts them. To the end that ſlauiſh feare then ſhould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their returne, God heere tels them, hee will be their husband; neither will he forget that firſt couenant and coniunction, which in former time hee vouchſafed to make with them.

                     <note place="margin">The ſumme.</note> 
                     <hi>you haue eſtranged your ſelues from me: yet returne now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto me, for I am ready to pardon you; and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you againe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as if you had alwayes kept your faith and loyalty with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after he adds, <hi>one out of a City, two out of a family.</hi> This place is well worthy our obſeruation: for God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſheweth, that they muſt not tarry one for another: moreouer, <hi>though all the body of the people generally ſhould rot in the filthineſſe of their ſinnes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God hath mercy in ſtore, if onely one will accept thereof.</note> yet if there were <hi>but one</hi> that would returne vnto him, he would alwayes be ready <hi>to entertaine that one into his fauour.</hi> Now this poynt was of exceeding great vſe. For Gods couenant was made to the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in generall; and therefore they might thinke with themſelues, that this couenant was vtterly aboliſhed, <hi>vnleſſe the whole people of God</hi> were againe gathered together. Neither had God indeed choſen to himſelfe out of this race, <hi>one or two;</hi> no, not an hundred, nor a thouſand: for hee had choſen <hi>the whole of-ſpring of Abraham.</hi> Now becauſe this promiſe was common to them all generally without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7696:92"/> euery one might thus conceit in himſelfe, But what haue I to doe with God, further than as in reſpect that I am deſcended of the race of <hi>Abraham?

Now we vnderſtand the Prophets meaning.</p>
                  <p>I grant the expoſitors vnderſtand theſe words, <hi>one of a City,</hi> as if God would not refuſe to pardon three or foure, although all the multitude beſides periſhed. But they touch not the maine matter which was chiefly intended; to wit, that God reſtraines his ſpeech to <hi>two or three,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as hath been ſaid) they might bee in perplexitie when they ſhould thinke with themſelues, that all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally were choſen to bee a people conſecrated vnto God.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7696:93"/> they labour to fetch that farre enough off too: namely, that they ſhould no more carry with them the Arke of the couenant into battaile. Why ſo? Becauſe no enemie ſhould afterwards inuade them.

But wee may eaſily ſee, that theſe words will not at any hand beare this ſenſe. Others ſay, this muſt be referred to the time of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: neither indeed doth any one of the Iewes deny this, in regard it followes afterwards, in verſ. 18. that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſhall returne with the tribe of Iudah. Which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto was not accompliſhed: whence it followes, that the Prophet heere propheſieth of the kingdome of Chriſt: and yet the Iewes in confeſſing this, thinke nothing at all heere of the abrogation of ceremonies.

And who would not iudge, but that this expoſition had ſome good likelihood of truth? But yet I thinke this comes nothing neere the Prophets meaning. For he ſpeakes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly heere, of that diſcord or diuorce which had now a long time continued betweene the kingdome of Iudah, and the kingdome of Iſrael: for albeit the kingdome of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Iſrael flouriſhed moſt, both in reſpect of the multitudes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of their men, and the large extent of their dominion; as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> alſo in regard of their abundance of riches; and that for theſe conſiderations they were to be preferred farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the kingdome of Iudah: yet in ſome reſpects the kingdome of Iudah was to bee preferred far before them. For firſt, they had among them the Temple, which had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> been built by the expreſſe commandement of the Lord;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7696:94"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the place alſo wherein it was built, was of his owne chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> beſides, they had with them the Arke of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Whence that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation ſprang, which ſo long continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two kingdomes.</note> which was a pledge of his preſence. Hence grew the emulation and debate betweene the kingdome of Iudah, and the ten Tribes. The Iſraelites they ſwelled in regard of their multitudes, both of men, and riches, with other carnall reſpects: on the other ſide, the Iewes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their Temple, and in the Arke of the Couenant.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7696:94"/> which it was before. Why ſo? In regard the poſterity of <hi>Ahraham</hi> was (as it were) ſcattered and diſperſed: for the people whom the Lord meant to maintaine in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly concord (with an holy and inuiolable band) had been notwithſtanding wofully diuided and rent in ſunder one from another: for we know there was a deadly fude betweene theſe two houſes.

                  <note place="margin">The expoſition of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſes is ſtill contsnued.</note> 
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Eſterſtay we began to ſhew in what ſenſe the Prophet ſaith, that the Arke of the Lords couenant ſhould be no more men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, after the Iſraelites returne into their owne countrey; and that they ſhall be there multiplied and encreaſed; namely, becauſe that diſſenſion which was once betweene them before their captiuity, ſhould now vtterly ceaſe. For we know that the Iſraelites had their manner of ſeruing God apart by themſelues, in regard they had forſaken the pure and ſound doctrine of the Law. The Prophet meant then to ſhew, <hi>that all of them ſhould become the true ſeruants of God, and that there ſhould be ſuch vnity of faith amongst them, that the Iewes and Iſraelites ſhould no more ſerue God after diuers faſhions.</hi> And that is the cauſe why hee adds, <hi>it ſhall no more come into their heart:</hi> that is to ſay, It ſhall no more be thought on. <hi>Neither ſhall it bee remembred:</hi> that is, <hi>there ſhall remaine no more ſignes of differences and diſcord, as in times paſt. Neither ſhall they viſit it:</hi> that is, thoſe who heretofore deſired to offer ſacrifice to God, ſhall no more come to Ieruſalem by ſtealth. In a word, <hi>the caſe ſhall be quite and cleane altered from that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for in that time Ieruſalem ſhall bee called the throne of the Lord.</hi> But it ſeemes the Prophet contradicts himſelfe, where he ſaith, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Ieruſalem ſhall be the throne of the Lord; and yet no mention ſhall be made of the Arke of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> but theſe two things agree very well together. For his meaning is, that Ieruſalem ſhall be the eternall throne and dwelling place of the Lord, without any controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7696:95"/> or contradiction. Before the Iſraelites were led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, they bragged as hauing the true and ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God amongſt them, and that in great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>pe and outward oſtentation; ſo as Ieruſalem (in compariſon thereof) was in a manner nothing, as touching the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance. Now the Prophet ſaith, there ſhall be no more this kind of difference, neither ſhall the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene the Iewes and the Iſraelites continue any longer. Why ſo? Becauſe both of them ſhould (without contradiction) hold Ieruſalem to be the Sanctuary of the Lord: as if hee ſhould ſay, All without exception ſhall ſerue God purely; which in times paſt was farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Which hee yet better confirmes by the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All nations ſhall be gathered vnto it, to the name of the Lord:</hi> or, <hi>becauſe of the name of the Lord.</hi> Thus then all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be gathered together vnto Ieruſalem, for the loue they beare to the name of the Lord. We ſee there is no ambiguity in theſe words; for the Prophet plainly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, that the ſeruice which God had ordained in his Law, ſhould be in ſuch eſtimation, that all nations ſhould be ready to imbrace whatſoeuer ſhould be taught them by the Iewes. And yet <hi>by all nations,</hi> it may be hee meant the ten Tribes, who alſo in many other places are called many nations. If any will extend the words further, I gainſay him not: and (as yeſterday I noted) the Iewes are of opinion, that the time of the Meſſias is heere deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed; in regard that which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heere promiſeth, was neuer fulfilled. For it is certaine, that ſuch a concourſe of all nations vnto Ieruſalem, after the Iewes were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home, was neuer ſeene, but the Iewes onely returned. Wherefore hence they conclude, that mention is heere made of Chriſt his kingdome: which I alſo conſent vnto. <hi>But in regard this returne and reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people was (as it were) a pledge and entrance vnto the kingdome of Christ:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore wt muſt alwayes begin to count from thence, as oft as the Prophets ſpeake of the new Church.</hi> I grant indeed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7696:96"/> wee are not to ſeeke the vniuerſall reſtauration of the whole world, any where elſe than in Chriſts comming: but the reſtauration of the Church began, when God firſt reached forth his hand to the Iewes, in the reedifying of the Temple, vntill the comming of Chriſt. As touching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this preſent text; whether by <hi>all nations,</hi> we vnderſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all the <hi>ten tribes;</hi> or <hi>both the kingdomes; or generally, all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nations of the earth;</hi> the matter is not great. The Prophets meaning is plaine enough; namely, that the Church ſhall grow greater than it was before, after God ſhall haue brought backe his people from their captiuity: as alſo, that he will cauſe true religion to flouriſh, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any brawles or contentions at all.</p>
               <p>And yet that which followes confirmes their opinion, who expound this place of both kingdomes: <hi>they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall walke no more after the ſtubbornneſſe of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart:</hi> for this is not wont to bee affirmed of ſuch as are meerly profane, who haue alwayes been ſtrangers from the doctrine of the Law. In regard this then, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines by a ſpeciall right, to the Iewes, and Iſraelites; therefore it ſeemes this expoſition will ſute beſt, to take <hi>all nations</hi> heere, for the ten tribes, or for the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>We are alſo to note that which is further added, <hi>They ſhall come together from the land of the North, into the land which I gaue their fathers to inherit.</hi> The Iewes at this time were not led captiue. For the Prophet himſelfe ſpake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being preſent in Ieruſalem, and whiles they were quietly ſetled in their countrey, as in their owne neſt: neither was it almoſt poſſible to perſwade them of that which afterwards, to their great coſt, they ſhould haue wofull experience of; namely, that ſoone after, they ſhould ſuffer the ſame exile which they then ſaw their brethren the Iſraelites felt, and taſted of. But the Prophet ſpeakes <hi>to them,</hi> euen as if they had been <hi>already baniſhed their countrey,</hi> and as if they had euen now taken vp their abode <hi>in the land of the North,</hi> as well as the Iſraelites.</p>

But the Prophet beats backe their replies, and vaine confidence; and affirmes, that <hi>the onely hope of their ſaluation depends now vpon the expectation which they ought to haue of their reſtitution from the Lord, after they had been for a time ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their owne countrey.</hi> Wherein the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends vnto them the fruit which ſhould redound vnto them by their captiuity,<note place="margin">No affliction ſo ſharpe, in which God giues not ſome hope of an happy iſſue. to the afflicted, in time c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In a word then, this is the Prophets meaning. <hi>God heere askes how it is poſſible for Abrahams posterity to multiply againe,</hi>

This interrogation</hi> tends to none other end, but to gaule the Iewes, as if they had bin vtterly loſt, and as if no hope at all had been left. And to ſay the truth, conſidering their obſtinate malice, by which they had prouoked God to wrath, they could not be otherwiſe perſwaded, but they ſhould all periſh. <hi>God therefore ſpeakes here as a man amazed:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>you indeed for good cauſe, are hopeleſſe, your ſaluation is at an end: but in regard I haue determined to restore you into your firſt eſtate, I will deuiſe a way to multiply your race againe.</hi> But by what meanes? Truly hee layes no greater a burthen vpon them. <hi>Then to call him Father;</hi> not with mouth onely, but with a true and hearty affection. Wee ſee now what the Prophet meant to ſay: for in bringing in God admiring (as it were) it is to humble the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, as if the thing had been hard to bring about. In the meane while he encourageth them notwithſtanding, in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7696:97"/> that he ſhewes their ſaluation is ready at hand, <hi>if ſo be they ſhall call vpon God,</hi> in the vprightneſſe of their hearts, and acknowledge him <hi>their father:</hi> prouided alſo that they <hi>perſeuere therein, without euer turning away from him.</hi> To be ſhort, his meaning is, that the Iſraelites are but as dead men, and that they are neuer to expect a better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, vnleſſe they be (as it were) raiſed againe from the dead. And yet this hee promiſeth them vpon condition (as we haue ſaid) that <hi>they call vpon him, not from the teeth outward, or by ſtarts; for that zeale ſoone vaniſheth away.

                  <p>HE confirmes that which he ſaid in the beginning of the former verſe.

                  <p>HEre we may more euidently perceiue that which I touched erewhile; namely, that the Iſraelites are ſet as a ſpectacle for the Iewes; to the end theſe peruerſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whom God had ſo long ſpared, might know they ſhould by no meanes eſcape ſcot-free, vnleſſe they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betimes to the Lord their God. For the Prophet here ſhewes how the Iſraelites <hi>lamented,</hi> and <hi>wept,</hi> in regard they had ſeuered themſelues from their God, and had violated their faith which once they plighted to him. But what of all this? Euen that the Iewes who pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their delights, might bee awakened; and that they ſhould as verily keepe their turne alſo <hi>in weeping and mourning;</hi> vnleſſe they betimes preuented Gods iuſt iudgements. It is true that the teares and lamentations of the Iſraelites were not yet ſuch, that by them the ſignes of true repentance might be diſcerned: neither is it the Prophets meaning heere, highly to extoll their piety; hee onely meant to note, that they were thus ſharply cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed, becauſe they had forſaken God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There was a voyce</hi> then <hi>heard in the high places</hi> (ſaith he) that is, it was manifeſt enough, that the Iſraelites were cruelly afflicted by the enemies. <hi>Now then, they cry and weepe; now they thinke themſelues the onely miſerable people in the world.</hi> But whence come theſe lamentations?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They had</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>peruerted their way:</hi> which is as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7696:98"/> much as if he had ſaid, what a prodigious thing is it to ſee the Iewes thus ſottiſh, as not to be a whit touched with repentance, by the puniſhments which are inflicted vpon their brethren? For the afflictions which befell the the Iſraelites, aſtoniſhed the whole world; becauſe that kingdome and countrey which had long flouriſhed, was now diſpeopled; and in ſtead of them, wild beaſts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the land, vntill ſome were ſent from perſia, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of the Weſterne parts, to inhabite there. How was it poſſible then, that a countrey ſo rich and populous, ſhould lie waſt? Euen becauſe God had ſo foretold it by <hi>Moſes: You haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>reiected my Sabbaths;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.34.35</note> 
                     <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall your land reſt, and ſhall no more be diſquieted by you.</hi> This was a very horrible ſpectacle of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the nations a farre off might well thinke with themſelues, Surely this people hath grieuouſly offended God, ſeeing he hath ſo ſeuerely ſcourged them. Now the Iewes which ſaw ſuch a waſt made in this land before their eyes, and their brethren thus diſperſed heere and there, muſt they not be more than ſenſeleſſe, when they tooke none of theſe things to heart? We ſee then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets meaning. <hi>A voyce</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>was heard vpon the high places:</hi> as if the Iſraelites had cried and wept vpon the tops of the mountaines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The teares</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of prayers:</hi> yet he meanes not thoſe <hi>prayers</hi> which were the teſtimonies of true faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Hee onely vnderſtands thoſe lamentations which teſtified their ſorrow vnder their afflictions. The Prophet meant not then to ſhew heere what confeſſion the Iſraelites made; but rather to note out the cauſe why they were brought thus pitifully to bewaile their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſeries: namely, <hi>becauſe they had peruerted their wayes, and had forgotten the Lord their God.</hi> It followes.</p>

                     <hi>albeit they haue grieuouſly offended:</hi> and afterwards, he brings in the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites themſelues <hi>with their anſwere; Behold wee come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, &amp;c.</hi> or, we will come: For there is greater likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that the Prophet ſpeakes heere of that conuerſion of the ten Tribes, which ſhould afterward bee effected. Heere is <hi>a kind of dialogue then,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</note> 
                     <hi>betweene God, and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</hi> God of his meere grace calles them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſaying, <hi>Returne ye rebellious children.</hi> In the next place he promiſeth <hi>to play the part of a good phyſition, in healing all their diſeaſes. I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will heale your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions:</hi> that is, I will blot out all your ſinnes, and will abſolue you from all your offences. See heere what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God performes on his part. Firſt, he ſummons the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to repentance, and then promiſeth them pardon; telling them that the remedie is ready at hand, if they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not their hearts againſt this call. On the other ſide, the Iſraelites for their parts anſwere, <hi>Behold we will come vnto thee.</hi> Now in this place the Prophet taxeth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the Iewes, when he ſaith, the Iſraelites ſhall not harden their neckes, after God hath once graciouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them home to himſelfe, but will rather ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues flexible and ready to yeeld obedience to his voyce. I grant this was not accompliſhed in reſpect of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, after they had leaue to returne; onely ſome few of them were thus affected; who preferred Gods honour,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7696:99"/> before their owne priuate commodities. I ſay there were very few, euen of theſe: neither is it any great maruell. For it is not without cauſe God ſaid before, that albeit there came but one out of a City,<note place="margin">See verſ. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> or but two out of a Tribe, yet for all that he would readily receiue them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though others in the meane while ſhould remaine har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in their obſtinate courſes. How euer it be, God heere ſignifies, that the Iſraelites ſhall not be ſo head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, but <hi>they ſhall yeeld to his admonitions,</hi> after he hath giuen them <hi>good hope of pardon,</hi> and of their redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which he the rather doth, that he might make the obſtinacy of the Iewes to become ſo much the more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deteſtable.</p>
                  <p>Others thinke the Prophet heere reprocheth the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, in regard they alwayes pretended as if they ſought the Lord. Thus they thinke then: You ſhall ſay indeed, <hi>Behold we come vnto thee, thou art our God:</hi> as if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their hypocriſie, becauſe they alwayes made faire ſhewes in ſeeking God. But me thinkes they are far wide from the Prophets meaning.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7696:101"/> youth; by which words they ſignified, that the miſery had continued long. For God had not chaſtiſed them for one day onely, but had redoubled the ſame corrections, and yet without any fruit.</p>
                  <p>Now they adde further, <hi>Euen as we haue wickedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued our ſelues against the Lord our God, from our youth;</hi> ſo alſo hath he euen <hi>from our youth</hi> admoniſhed vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto him; neither did hee endeauour any thing more, than to effect the ſame: for hee called vs. Seeing then we haue been thus obſtinate againſt him, God hath accordingly proſecuted vs in his wrath, and that moſt iuſtly.</p>
                  <p>After they ſay, <hi>to this day.</hi> By which words they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which I ſaid before: to wit, they were ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, that they <hi>neuer deſiſted</hi> from their vngodly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And therewithall hee notes out the cauſe of all this miſchiefe; namely, <hi>becauſe they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord their God.</hi> For had they erred, and God had not ſpoken vnto them; their fault might haue been either ſome way excuſed, or leſſened. <hi>But ſeeing God ſent his Prophets vnto them daily, one after another, who ceaſed not to call them to repentance; and yet they hearkened not at all;</hi> there was not ſo much as the appearance of an excuſe to be made in their behalfe, who had thus hardened their hearts in following their euill wayes. Thus then wee ſee how he amplifies their fault yet further, by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>that they heard not the voyce of the Lord:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, God was not wanting to them on his part, to withdraw them from perdition; but ſo farre were they hardened in their impieties, that they deſpiſed this mercy which God offered them.

This is the ſumme
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7696:102"/> and ſcope of the Prophets doctrine: but there is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the words. For ſome reade this place thus, Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el if thou returne to me, ſaith the Lord: ſo they ioyne theſe words, <hi>to me,</hi> with the former member, and then reade, <hi>thou ſhalt haue reſt,</hi> apart; and ſo they will haue one and the ſame ſentence twiſe repeated: for by and by it followes, <hi>If thou take away thine abominations from before my face, thou ſhalt not depart from thy place:</hi> that is to ſay, I will not caſt thee out, as I haue threatened thee. Others take the verbe which is heere twiſe repeated in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, in one and the ſame ſignification; <hi>Iſrael if thou conuert, conuert to me.</hi> It is certaine, that the Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Iſraelites to returne vnto God in ſincerity, and not in hypocriſie, as they were wont to doe. Now I haue told you what others thinke, but as I take it, the reading will agree better thus, <hi>Iſrael, if thou conuert, repoſe thy ſelfe in me,</hi> And then after, <hi>and if thou take away thine abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</hi> I take this <hi>And,</hi> to ſignifie as much as, To wit. <hi>That is to wit</hi> then, <hi>if thou take away thine abominations from before my face, and if thou trotteſt no more hither and thither.</hi> For where others expound it (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>Iſrael, if thou returne, thou ſhalt haue reſt:</hi> it ſeemes to me vnapt; yea, I vtterly miſlike this expoſition: but if any will reade, <hi>Iſrael, if thou returne, ſtay thy ſelfe in me,</hi> I leaue it to his choyce. Or thus; Iſrael, if thou conuert, conuert vnto me. For there is no great difference; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Prophet reprooues the Iſraelites for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and diſſimulation which they had formerly vſed, ſhewing ſignes euer and anon as if they had been ready to haue obeyed God, and to frame themſelues to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; and yet by and by after, manifeſted to all by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that they meant no ſuch matter. In regard then they had ſo oft prooued themſelues lyars, and full of deceit; therefore it is that the Prophet in the perſon of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to returne vnto God without faining. If wee reade, <hi>Iſrael, returne to me,</hi> the reaſon of it will bee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they alwayes laboured to make long circuits, leſt they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7696:102"/> ſhould come directly vnto God.</hi> For it is ordinary with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, to make goodly ſhewes of conuerſion: but in the meane while to get themſelues as farre off from God as they can. This is the Prophets meaning then, if we follow this reading: Iſrael, I wiſh thee to be wiſer, than to thinke thou ſhalt gaine ought by this deceitfull courſe, when hereafter thou ſhalt faine a conuerſion. <hi>Returne to me</hi> then, that is to ſay, know that thou haſt to doe with God, who will not be mocked nor deceiued, no more than he mockes or deceiues others. <hi>Returne to me then, with thine whole heart, let there now be no faining in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> But if we thinke it better to expound the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word in the ſecond place, in a diuers ſignification from the former, there will be no great difference neither in that reading, as touching the ſenſe: <hi>Iſrael if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, reſt thy ſelfe in me:</hi> that is to ſay, for the time to come, <hi>renounce all thine idols, and all thy wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe luſts.</hi> And thus the Prophet in briefe ſhewes, that <hi>there is no other meanes of true conuerſion, but for Iſrael to repoſe himſelfe quietly in God onely;</hi> and not to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be tranſported hither and thither, as a vagabond after his vaine luſts, as often as he had done before.</p>
                  <p>And thus that which followes agrees very well, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>if thou take away thine abominations out of my ſight:</hi> for (as I haue ſaid) this particle <hi>And,</hi> may be taken by way of expoſition thus, <hi>To wit, if thou take away, &amp;c.</hi> For this is the vice which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> meant principally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne; namely, that the Iſraelites made outward ſhewes of piety and religion, but were notwithſtanding euer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, and could not from the heart giue ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto God, but alwayes hung in ſuſpenſe which way to take: neither is it without cauſe that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooues this vice in them; and therefore alſo doe I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receiue this expoſition, <hi>Iſrael, if thou returne, ſtay thy ſelfe in me:</hi> that is, abide firmely and conſtantly in me. But how may this be done? namely, <hi>if thou take thine abominations out of my ſight, and ceaſeſt to trace vp and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7696:103"/> downe like a vagabond, according to thy former lightneſſe and inconſtancy,</hi>

                     <hi>which is but too well knowne already.</hi> How e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, the place is very remarkable againſt all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who though they dare not openly reiect all admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of the Prophets and holy men of God, yet vnder pretext of ſome faire ſhewes of repentance, they ſeeke out all the ſtarting holes they can inuent, to eſtrange them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from God. No doubt but with their lips they will pretend to ſeeke God; but in the meane while they finde euaſions, that they may not come neare him: which is the reaſon why I ſaid, that this is a very excellent place, teaching vs, that God contents not himſelfe with nifles, which conſiſt in the inuentions of hypocrites, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the vprightneſſe and ſincerity of the heart, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deteſts <hi>all diſſimulation.</hi> For which cauſe he expreſly adds, <hi>If thou take away thine abominations from before mine eyes:</hi> for hypocrites alwayes loue to be ſeene of men, and ſeeke to be approoued of them; reſting in that opinion which they conceiue of them. But God in the meane while calles them <hi>to himſelfe:</hi> and we are alſo to note, that he can neither be mocked nor deceiued; becauſe it is he <hi>who ſearcheth the heart and raynes.</hi>

                  <p>HEre the Prophet proſecutes the ſame matter: for he refels all theſe goodly ſhewes by which they thought God would bee pacified. For whileſt they had the name of God in their mouthes, they thought that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to iuſtifie their cauſe. As how? <hi>Call we not vpon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> name of the Lord? yeeld we not vnto him his due honour, when we ſweare by his name?</hi> For the Prophet takes one particular for the generall; namely, <hi>ſwearing by Gods name, for his whole worſhip.</hi> Becauſe the Iewes then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the name of God, thinking they had ſo throughly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7696:103"/> purged themſelues, that none could charge them with any fault; therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt ſweare the Lord liueth in truth:</hi> that is, you hold your ſelues ſafe and ſecure; in regard you imagine that a bare ſhew, and an outward appearance of godlineſſe will ſerue the turne, to procure your abſolution from all your ſinnes: and that God will be well enough appeaſed, as oft as you boaſt your ſelues to be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and (in a word) <hi>as oft as you ſweare the Lord liueth.</hi> But in the meane while perceiue you not how ſacrilegious you are in abuſing the ſacred name of God, in this falſe manner. <hi>Sweare</hi> then (ſaith he) <hi>in truth.</hi> Now we ſee how the Prophets words depend one vpon another. In the former verſe hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the people <hi>lyed vnto God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> in regard they neuer kept touch with him, but brake their promiſe. For they alwayes wandred from him. Now he adds, that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſhall gaine nothing by calling vpon God thus in this outward appearance, ſhewing by their <hi>outward geſtures,</hi> that they were his people, and did him very good ſeruice: all this (ſaith hee) is nothing, vnleſſe you <hi>ſerue God, in truth, in iudgement, and in righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No doubt but <hi>truth,</hi> is heere taken for the vprightneſſe and integrity of the heart:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.3.</note> as wee ſhall ſee afterwards in the fifth chapter. In regard he commands them then, <hi>to ſweare by the name of God in truth:</hi> it is as much as if hee had ſaid, that God is not duly ſerued, according as of right he ought to be, vnleſſe the heart bee emptied and purged from all fraud and diſſembling. In a word, hee ſhewes, <hi>that where the ſincerity and integrity of the heart is wanting, there can no acceptable ſeruice bee performed vnto God.</hi> But this <hi>truth</hi> whereof the Prophet ſpeakes, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally knowne by <hi>iudgement and iuſtice:</hi> namely, when men conuerſe one with another in vprightneſſe, and when euery one renders to his neighbour that which to him appertaines; alſo where none ſeekes his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, with the diſaduantage of another. When this <hi>equity</hi> (I ſay) and vprightneſſe heere mentioned is thus
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7696:104"/> preſerued and kept amongſt men, then is that accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed which the Prophet in this place requires: becauſe men honour not God with ſhewes, nor with vaine and lying words, but where they ſhew indeed that they ſerue God without any vizard of holineſſe, and they yeeld him that reuerence which he deſerueth.</p>
                  <p>That which followes, <hi>and all nations ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> is alſo expounded ſundry wayes by the expoſitors: yet I make no queſtion, but the Prophet heere cloſely taxeth the Iſraelites, in regard Gods name was expoſed to many reproches, whileſt they gaue profane nations cauſe to ſay, <hi>that there was no power nor ſtrength in the God of Iſrael:</hi> yea and the Iſraelites themſelues often expoſtulated the matter with God, as if he had giuen them iuſt cauſe ſo to doe. As how? God promiſed vs that we ſhould be made mirrours of his bleſſing: and yet in the meane while wee lie open heere to all the iniuries profane people can lade vs withall. How hangs theſe things together? Becauſe the Iſraelites then murmured thus in reſpect of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and thus wronged the Lord; the Prophet anſweres them, <hi>The nations ſhall be bleſſed in God, and ſhall glory in him.</hi> Some referre this to the people of Iſrael, but very vnaptly. I grant he promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> that all nations ſhould be bleſſed, or ſhould bleſſe themſelues in his ſeed: but this bleſſing had not his beginning in them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Prophet heere noteth. For reſpect muſt be had to the cauſe of this bleſſing. How could the nations bleſſe themſelues in the ſeed or of-ſpring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> vnleſſe God, who is the authour of this bleſſing, had manifeſted his grace towards the children of <hi>Abraham?</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet then ſpeakes very aptly heere, when he ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall all nations bleſſe themſelues in God, and ſhall glory in him:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>your ſelues are the cauſe why Gods curſe preſſeth you thus, and that you are a reproach in the ſight of all the heathen:</hi> as alſo, <hi>why the name of God is blaſphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations.</hi> For your owne impiety conſtraines God to handle you more ſeuerely than otherwiſe hee would:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7696:104"/> for according to his nature hee is enclined to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fauourable and gracious vnto you. What is the cauſe then, <hi>why all nations bleſſe not the Lord, and that they glory not in him?</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">What hurt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors doo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and others by their bad conuerſation.</note> 
                     <hi>that pure religion ſpreads not it ſelfe throughout the whole world, and that the Gentiles ioyne not with you in approouing the worſhip of the onely true God?</hi> Euen <hi>your impiety and malicious obſtinacy is it, which hinders Gods glory, and that the whole world rings not of your happineſſe and felicity.</hi> We now then haue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets meaning: namely, that the Iewes did expoſtulate the matter with God without cauſe, in reſpect of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities which they endured; becauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had ſought out, and alſo heaped vpon their owne heads all theſe euils, and had therewithall giuen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane nations matter and occaſion thus wickedly to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and blaſpheme the ſacred name of God. Now it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet ſtill proſecutes the ſame doctrine: for he reprehends the hypocriſie of the Iſraelites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would needs ſatisfie God withoutward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies onely, albeit their hearts were full fraught with fraud, malice, and all other impieties. Therefore hee ſaith, <hi>God willes the Iewes to plow vp their fallow ground, and no more to ſowe among thornes:</hi> which is a very apt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. For the Scripture is wont to compare vs <hi>to a field,</hi> when it cals vs the Lords heritage. And therefore are we indeed choſen to be Gods peculiar people, that he might <hi>reape ſome fruit</hi> of vs; euen as the husband man lookes to reape commodity of his fields and poſſeſſions. True it is that God reapes no benefit by vs: that which he requires of vs is this, that our whole life may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his glory. How euer it be, yet God would not haue
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7696:105"/> vs idle, <hi>nor vnfruitfull,</hi> but that we ſhould yeeld him ſome commodity. In the meane while what do the hypocrites? <hi>They ſowe indeed:</hi> that is, they ſeeme to haue ſome deſire; nay more than that, they loue to haue it knowne, that they are repleniſhed with a wonderfull deale of zeale, when God calles or exhorts them to repentance. They keepe a great bluſtering then, but they marre and corrupt all by their <hi>mixtures:</hi> euen as if one ſhould ſowe his ſeed among thornes. Now it is certaine, <hi>that ſeed thus ſowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes</hi> neuer comes to good, vnleſſe the ground be firſt well husbanded and tilled. God then derides <hi>ſuch a fond diligence</hi> whereabouts hypocrites buſie themſelues ſo much, when he tels them they doe but labour in vaine: becauſe it is all one as if an husband man ſhould goe caſt his feed againſt the wind. For when the ground is once peſtered with briars and thornes, albeit the ſeed ſowne there ſhould come vp; yet would it neuer beare any fruit. This is the reaſon why God would haue the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>to plow vp their fallow ground:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, you reſemble a field full of thornes and briars, and therefore you haue need to be plowed vp, not after an ordinary manner. For where a field is ouer-growne with theſe brambles, what would it auaile a man, if hee ſhould ſowe neuer ſo much graine there? neither indeed would the plough be ſufficient to till ſuch a piece of ground to any purpoſe; but of neceſſity ſome coſt muſt firſt bee beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon the ſame by ſome other meanes; namely, the thornes muſt be ſtubbed vp. The Prophet ſignifies then, that the people were growne hardened in their iniquities, ſo as they were not onely full of many vices, as if a piece of ground had lien ſome two or three yeeres fallow; but there were inward and more priuie ſinnes which lurked in them, which the plough could not well get out, vnleſſe paines were taken before in ſtubbing them vp by the roots; euen as when thornes, briars, and brambles, haue (for many yeeres together) taken root in a field. We ſee now then, how the Prophet not only meant to ſhew that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7696:105"/> there harboured in this people of Iſrael ſome impieties; as the contempt of God, and other enormities: but they were growne obſtinate therein; becauſe for a long time they had taken deepe rooting in their ſinnes, ſo as <hi>there was not onely need of a plough, but of other inſtruments and tooles, to ſtubbe vp theſe thornes,</hi> which had taken ſo deepe rooting in them. As before then he ſhewed,<note place="margin">See verſ. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> that they loſt their labour, vnleſſe with a ſincere and pure affection of heart they turned vnto God, reſting themſelues in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: ſo he heere commands them to examine and ſift their liues in good earneſt, and not to ſowe their ſeed at aduenture, like the hypocrites, who make a ſlight confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſinnes. He bids them then, carefully <hi>to ſearch into their ſecret and hidden ſinnes,</hi> as if they were to root vp thornes and bryars out of a field, which had long lien fallow and vntilled. now it followes.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet here more plainly expreſſeth that which before he deliuered vnder a metaphor or borrowed ſpeech. For he willed them to pluck vp thoſe vices which had taken deepe rooting: as men are wont to purge fields that haue long lien fallow, of thornes &amp; brambles. But now without any figure, hee tels them plainly what they ought to doe: though yet in this latter part of the ſentence, there wants not a figuratiue manner of ſpeech alſo.

                     <note place="margin">Circumciſion a ſigne of reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> which was vnto them as a ſigne of their renouation: as if he ſhould ſay, you know well enough what you ought to doe, were it not you are growne ſo vnteachable, that it is vnpoſſible to make you vnderſtand any thing. For (ſaith he) why was circumciſion ordained? meant not God by this ſigne
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7696:106"/> to teach you, that if a man bend himſelfe to be truly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, he muſt begin at the meditation hereof; namely, <hi>that he abſtaine from all the ſinfull affections of the fleſh:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion imports.</note> 
                     <hi>that he renounce himſelfe, and be dead (as it were) both to himſelfe and to the world:</hi> for thus much <hi>circumciſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</hi> The Prophet therefore ſhewes, that the Iſraelites were altogether inexcuſable, in regard they failed neither through errour, nor ignorance; but carried themſelues wickedly and fraudulently towards God; becauſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which was (as it were) their entrance into Gods ſeruice, gaue ſufficient notice, that they yeelded to God neither his due, nor true ſeruice, vnleſſe they <hi>renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelues.</hi> We ſee now what the Prophet meant to ſay, when he wils them <hi>to be circumciſed to the Lord, &amp;c. Be circumciſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Lord.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe circumciſion was the thing they then moſt gloried in; to wit, onely before men. For albeit with full mouth they bragged, and prided themſelues much in this, that they were Gods peculiar people, yet was this nothing elſe but meere vanity and ambition in them. The Prophet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wils them to diſpatch out of their hearts all theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flings, and to be circumciſed <hi>to the Lord;</hi> that is, not to ſtand muſing how to obtaine the fauour and praiſe <hi>of men;</hi> but rather wiſely to conſider how they had to doe <hi>with God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What God aimed at in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the fore-skin.</note> For which cauſe he adds, <hi>Take away the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of your hearts:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abrahams</hi> breed to bee circumciſed, was it in regard he delighted to haue this little skin to be offered him as a ſacrifice? No, hee aimed at a farre other end; namely, <hi>the circumciſion of the heart.</hi> In a word, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teacheth that heere, which <hi>Paul</hi> hath more cleerly expounded in Rom. 2.29. to wit, that <hi>the letter</hi> is nothing <hi>before God;</hi> but he requires <hi>the ſpirit.</hi> For by theſe words <hi>Paul</hi> meanes, that <hi>the outward ſigne</hi> is nothing, vnleſſe the <hi>inward truth</hi> thereof be added thereunto: for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the letter with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſignifies as much <hi>as the outward ceremony:</hi> as amongſt vs wee may call it the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7696:106"/> literall Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Literall Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme what.</note> when neither faith nor repentance goes with it.

                     <note place="margin">Spirituall Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion what.</note> whereof the Prophet heere ſpeakes. And <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo toucheth the ſame, Deut. 10.16. for there he ſhewes how the Iewes much deceiued themſelues, if they thought to ſatisfie God with the bare circumciſion of the fleſh: therefore ſaith he, <hi>circumciſe the fore-skin of your hearts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</note> I grant in another place he ſhewes, that this is <hi>Gods peculiar worke:</hi> but howſoeuer God circumciſeth the heart, <hi>yet it is not in vaine that men are exhorted to circumciſe themſelues ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:</hi> which alſo we may now ſay of Baptiſme. For when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the faithfull to the feare of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.</note> and to holineſſe of life, hee brings in Baptiſme therewithall: and yet it is certaine that men attribute not that to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which God ſignifies vnto vs by the ſigne of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. But his meaning is,<note place="margin">God commands vs that which we are vnable to doe, that we might ſeeke to him for ability to doe it.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhould aske of God the grace of his holy ſpirit, that the outward ſigne become not vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto vs, by wanting the inward truth therof.</hi> Thus then, when the Prophet commands the Iſraelites <hi>to take away the fore-skin of their hearts;</hi> it is all one as if he had ſaid vnto them, <hi>I ſee you are but too liberall in preferring cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and the outward ſeruice; but what auailes all this, vnleſſe the integrity of the heart goe before?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he ſpeakes <hi>to the Iewes, and to the inhabitants of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in regard they thought themſelues more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the Iſraelites, vpon whom God had inflicted ſo heauie chaſtiſements. Thus then he ſhewes that the <hi>Tribe of Iudah;</hi> yea euen <hi>the inhabitants of Ieruſalem,</hi> were no better than others; and that they were no more priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged than their brethren; but they muſt be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, as well as they, vnleſſe they returned in time, yea and that without faining too.</p>
                  <p>After he adds, <hi>leſt my wrath breake forth like fier, &amp;c.</hi> Heere the Prophet freely and plainly denounceth, that the Iewes <hi>muſt not differre their repentance, till God declare
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7696:107"/> himſelfe their iudge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Repentance muſt not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, for feare of after-claps.</note> 
                     <hi>in executing his vengeance vpon them; for then it will be too late.</hi> To be ſhort, hee admoniſheth them <hi>to preuent Gods iudgements betimes; for if Gods wrath begin once to burne, it will vtterly conſume and deſtroy them, like a fier.</hi> It will be no time then, to quench this fier. But on the contrary, <hi>if they now repent, he ſets before them ſome hope of pardon, in regard the wrath of God was not as yet kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the nex place he adds, <hi>becauſe of the wickedneſſe of your actions:</hi> by which words the Prophet gaules them yet further to the quicke, and ſhewes they ſhall gaine nothing by their cauils: for if God be once ſet vpon his iudgement ſeat, and ſhall but begin to execute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; there will then be no more place for any of their vaine replies or excuſes: to wit, as if they deſerued not to be ſo ſeuerely dealt withall; and that the nature of their ſinnes were not ſo hainous.

For whileſt God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  <p>IN regard the <hi>regall dignity</hi> as yet remained among the Iewes, albeit their power was much diminiſhed: they truſting in their <hi>King,</hi> thought themſelues in regard thereof, in great ſafety: and this was the reaſon why they trembled at no threatning. For this name <hi>of a Kingdome,</hi> though not altogether in its perfection, yet in ſuch a mean eſtate as it then was, ſerued them as an anuill, to beat back all the Prophets blowes. Moreouer, we know how pride alwayes poſſeſſeth the harts of courtiers. For as they high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie the greatneſſe of their Kings, ſo inſult they, in regard of their wiſedome and courage. Becauſe this fond conceit of their <hi>King</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, together with the great craks <hi>of the chief courtiers,</hi> deceiued the Iewes: The Prophet ſaith, <hi>In that day both the heart of the King, and the heart of his great men, ſhould faile.</hi> Neither is it to be doubted, but by this word <hi>heart,</hi> he meanes the vnderſtanding: the word
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7696:110"/> being often ſo taken in many places:<note place="margin">Heart taken for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> God (ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 29.4.) hath not hitherto giuen thee <hi>an heart:</hi> and the Latines alſo call him<note n="*" place="margin">Cordatus.</note> wiſe and diſcreet, who is of a quicke vnderſtanding, and of a ripe wit. Thus then, the Prophet ſhewes, that whereas the people fondly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>their King as a fortreſſe of inuincible defence; yet all would prooue in the end but meere froth and vanity.</hi> For then (ſaith he) the <hi>King ſhall be depriued of all ſenſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: the Counſellors</hi> alſo, who commonly ſhewed themſelues men of great ſpirits, ſhould then proue as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as poore bruit beaſts.

As much he affirmes, not only of them, but <hi>of the Prieſts and Prophets</hi> alſo; becauſe this order of Prieſthood carried in it a great ſplendor and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pompe. For the Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> aſſumed not this honour vnto it ſelfe; but God himſelfe had giuen the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his people <hi>to the Prieſts.</hi> For which cauſe all were generally perſwaded,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Some expound this place, as if the Prophet here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the peoples words. For it is the manner euen of the moſt wicked, to charge God fooliſhly, when his hand preſſeth them; and to braule and contend with him. They thinke then that the Prophet ſpeakes not here in his owne perſon, but in the perſon of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as if they ſhould ſay, Lord! what meaneth this? ſurely thou haſt deceiued vs. Others take it ſomewhat more ſtrictly; namely, that the Prophet heere makes his complaint to God, in regard hee ſuffered the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to abuſe the people by their flatteries, ſo as they had in a manner bewitched their minds and vnderſtandings: but there is another ſenſe, which I more willingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue of: for as I thinke, the Prophet tauntingly and ouerthwartly toucheth the falſe and pernicious flatteries wherewith the falſe Prophets had (in a manner) brought the poore Iewes vnto vtter ruine; in making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7696:111"/> they ſhould obtaine mercy of God, and alwayes preached to them pleaſing things. Neither are wee to doubt, but God rendred vnto the Iewes their iuſt teward, when he permitted them to be thus deceiued by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers. For we know the world hath alwayes been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſuch a ſickneſſe;<note place="margin">Worldlings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vp in their ſinnes.</note> namely, a deſire it hath to bee delighted with ſweet words, and vaine flatteries. As in Mich. 2.11. where God by his Prophet thus reprocheth the Iewes: You ſeeke our Prophets (ſaith hee) that may make you large promiſes of plentifull harueſts, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. By which you may perceiue how well they liked to be ſpared, and by no meanes to haue their ſinnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: alſo, that they not onely hated the true paſtors, and thoſe which ſharply reproued their vices; but vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deteſted them. God then for this cauſe was as willing that there ſhould be many hirelings, which ſhould aſſume vnto themſelues the name and title of Prophets. And thus it came to paſſe, that the Iewes alwayes dreamed of a peaceable eſtate: which (as I haue ſaid) is a thing very common with hypocrites. Now the Prophet heere by a uery tart and gauling manner of ſpeech, reprooues ſuch deceits. <hi>Ah, ah, Lord!</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſurely thou haſt deceiued this people.</hi> For the Prophet ſpeakes not heere, as in the perſon of the people; neither complaines hee becauſe God gaue this liberty and licenſe to the falſe Prophets; <hi>but in taunting wiſe he inſults as well ouer theſe deceiuers, as ouer the whole nation.</hi> Now in that he directs his ſpeech <hi>to God,</hi> it is in regard, none elſe would giue him audience. He ſpeakes <hi>to God</hi> then, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Behold, Lord, thoſe who affect flatteries, &amp; neuer had eares to hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the holy admonitions of thy faithfull ſeruants; are well worthy to be thus ſerued. Seeing then they would at no hand endure any correction; let them now learne that they haue been deceiued by others, rather than by thee.</hi> We now perceiue then, that the Prophet ſcornes ſuch a dulneſſe, as had cauſed the Iewes to become inſenſible ſo long a time together. And thus the naturall ſenſe is, <hi>I ſaid;</hi> that is, I turned mee to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7696:111"/> God. <hi>I ſaid</hi> then, <hi>Lord God; ſurely thou haſt deceiued this people.</hi> For this word <hi>ſurely,</hi> is put heere by way of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that is, <hi>it now appeares they were deceiued indeed. But by whom? I grant they would gladly lay the blame ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vpon thee; but they all well deſerued that the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould thus beguile them, for being too credulous.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſhall haue peace.</hi> Theſe words neuer came out of Gods mouth. For <hi>Ieremiah</hi> thundred daily, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally threatened their deſtruction. He was (as it were) an Herald ſent from heauen, to affright and terrifie the whole world; but none gaue him audience: the Iewes in the meane while applauded the falſe Prophets, who flattered, and entertained them with ſweet words, and faire promiſes. We ſee then, that God neuer ſpake of this, but the Iewes on the contrary, not onely willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but alſo much reioyced to heare of theſe goodly promiſes, which the falſe Prophets to gratifie them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, made vnto them. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then <hi>attributes that to God, by way of deriſion,</hi> which he knew well enough could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to none but to thoſe deceiuers.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he adds, <hi>and the ſword pierceth to the ſoule,</hi> that is, <hi>notwithſtanding we are now wounded with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and deadly blowes.</hi> Now heere the Prophet ſets theſe dangerous and wicked flatteries before the eyes of the Iewes, which cauſed them to lift vp their creſts: ſhewing, <hi>that in the end they ſhall aſſuredly feele how falſly they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the name of God.</hi>

He ſhewes then how great and horrible the calamity ſhall be, which he mentioned before: he compares it to a dry and ſharpe wind. The Hebrew word hath diuers ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications; but doubtleſſe hee ſpeakes heere of ſuch a wind as comes ruſhing with great violence, and diſturbs all the ayre; eſpecially when there is neither clouds, nor any trees to hinder the courſe thereof: and that is the cauſe why he ſpeakes of the high places, and deſerts. It is as much then as if he had ſaid, God will execute ſuch an horrible iudgement, and it ſhall come with ſuch violence, as if a whirlewind paſſed through high places, or through a dry land, or ſome deſert.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>by the way of the daughter of my people:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, the wind ſhall haue ſuch a paſſage as ſhall directly ceaze vpon Iudeah. Now this is a phraſe of ſpeech well enough knowne to them that haue been but meerly read in the Prophets, when he puts <hi>the daughter of the people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Daughter of my people, taken for the people themſelues.</note> for the people themſelus. This wind then, <hi>ſhall paſſe directly towards Iudeah.</hi> Afterwards hee adds, <hi>neither to fanne nor to cleanſe:</hi> for it is the manner of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen to fanne their corne in the ayre, ſo as you ſhall ſee the chaffe flie abroad, and be purged out by the wind. But the Prophet affirmes, that this wind ſhall <hi>neither fan nor cleanſe.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſhall be too boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous.</hi> In a word, his meaning is, that God ſhall bee ſo diſpleaſed with the Iewes, that he will not chaſtiſe them with ſuch gentleneſſe and moderation as in times paſt. For God had already corrected the Iewes often, but hee hitherto carried himſelfe in ſuch wiſe, as hee alwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (as it were) the part of a good phyſition;<note place="margin">God is deſirous as a good Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to cure the vices of people by ſparing them, but when this lenity is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he will fall to extremities.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his meaning was, to procure the ſaluing and curing of the peoples vices. But in as much as none of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections had done them any good, therefore the Prophet now affirmes, <hi>that God will come in wrath and indignation, which ſhall not ſerue as before, to cleanſe and purge them, by ſending away their of-ſcourings into the wind; but wholly to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7696:112"/> conſume and deſtroy whatſoeuer appertained to the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore he adds (for theſe two verſes depend one vpon another) <hi>a wind more full</hi> (ſaith he) or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>than thoſe, ſhall come.</hi> Others tranſlate, <hi>ſhall come from thoſe places.</hi> But it is to be taken rather as we haue turned it; namely, <hi>that this wind ſhall bee more terrible than other winds, which were wont to winnow the corne, in ſeparating it from the chaffe, or to purge the earth.</hi> The wind then ſhall be much more violent: <hi>and it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall come to me. I doubt not but God himſelfe ſpeakes this.</hi> Others thinke the Prophet heere repreſents the whole body of the people; and expound it, that a wind ſhall come ruſhing in vpon them: but this expoſition is vnapt; and the text it ſelfe confutes it. For that which followes next in the Prophet would not agree: <hi>now will I pronounce iudgements with them.</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> then, who in the perſon of a iudge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that a wind ſhall come vp <hi>at his command,</hi> to ſcatter and ouerthrow the whole land; but not to purge or cleanſe it. And thus he ſhewes how the Caldeans ſhall not come vp by their owne proper mouing, but ſhall be ready to accompliſh &amp; put that in execution, which God himſelfe ſhall enioyne them: as if he ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>and Amos</hi> 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>I my ſelfe am the author of all the euils which ſhall happen to the Iewes. It ſhall come to me</hi> then, that is, <hi>it ſhall bee ready to obey my commandement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, by way of expoſition he adds, <hi>Then will I ſpeake iudgements with them. To ſpeake iudgements,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.9. <hi>See chap.</hi> 1.16.</note> is as much to ſay, <hi>as to performe the office of a iudge,</hi> or to call to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to ſummon and cite one to make his anſwere in the place of iuſtice: as it is alſo ſaid, that Kings ſpeake iudgements, when they cauſe men to yeeld an account. In a word, Gods meaning heere is, that hitherto hee hath forborne the Iewes but too long: but in regard hee ſees the patience he hath vſed, is not onely fruitleſſe, but that they are become ſo much the more ſtubborne and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious: he teſtifies he will now play the part of a iudge with them, to puniſh their vngodly courſes. Now it followes.</p>

                  <p>HEre the Prophet in the ſhutting vp of his propheſie, expreſſeth the greatneſſe of Gods vengeance. Now hee vſeth two ſimilitudes to terrifie and awaken the Iewes.<note place="margin">Two ſimilitudes</note> He ſaith, <hi>the chariots of God ſhall come vp as clouds, and as a whirle-wind;</hi> and then, <hi>that his horſes ſhall be ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Eagles.</hi> Touching <hi>the clouds, and whirle-wind,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>the Eagles</hi> (for there is one and the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the three ſimilitudes) no doubt but the Prophet meant to ſignifie, that Gods vengeance ſhould come ſpeedily: and yet there is ſome difference. <hi>Wee ſee how in leſſe than the twinkling of an eye, the clouds are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and couer (as it were) all the heauens.</hi> Now this falles out <hi>when ſome whirle-wind ariſeth</hi> and troubleth the ayre. Thus then, when hee compares the chariots of God <hi>to clouds,</hi> and to <hi>a whirle-wind,</hi> it is as much as if hee had ſaid, <hi>that the beginning of the calamity ſhall come ſuddenly, in regard God ſhall ariſe ere they be aware, whileſt it ſeemes he hath a long time ſlept.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now in ſaying the horſes of God ſhall be <hi>ſwifter than Eagles;</hi> his meaning is, that God will not make much ado, neither ſhall it be difficult for him to bring all to nought in a moment; or at the leaſt, in a very ſhort ſpace to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the whole countrey of Iudeah, after hee hath once begun: <hi>for we know how ſwiftly and nimbly the Egle flies: and yet he ſaith, Gods horſes ſhall be more ſwift and nimble than all the Eagles in the world.</hi> Now we ſee the Prophets meaning. For the Iewes did nothing elſe but ſcorne the Prophets threatnings; and amongſt other things, this was very rife among them, Theſe Prophets are ſo hot, that they will not giue vs an houres reſpit. Well, yet at leaſt let vs be merry whileſt wee may, and neuer fill our ſelues with melancholy muſes: for we hope many yeeres

This is the reaſon then, why the Prophet ſaith, the chariots of God ſhall now aſcend and come vp, euen as the clouds, ſuddenly meet.

                  <p>Now in the end, the Prophet cries out, <hi>Woe vnto vs, for weare vndone.</hi> He heere <hi>cuts off his ſpeech;</hi> ſhewing that the falſe Prophets, as well as the common people, erred and went aſtray out of the right way to their owne perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whileſt they continued ſnorting thus in their euill wayes, perſwading themſelues that God would not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their careleſneſſe.

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:7696:114"/> ſeeing God was angry with them: now hee confirmes that ſpeech, <hi>Purge thine heart from all thine iniquity, that thou maiſt bee ſaued;</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, The Iewes are at warres with God: they cannot therefore eſcape, whileſt he is vp in armes to deſtroy them, nor whileſt he ſhewes himſelfe a ſeuere Iudge, in chaſtiſing them for their iniquities: and therewithall alſo he ſhewes what courſe muſt be taken to come to true repentance: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">The way to come to true repentance.</note>

                     <hi>that the beginning of repentance hath his ſeat in the affection of the heart.</hi> Now we haue the Prophets mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>And yet it is ill argued of them which hence would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that repentance is the cauſe of our ſaluation, becauſe <hi>God bids Ieruſalem to waſh her heart</hi> from her wickednes, that ſhe may be ſaued.<note place="margin">Repentance no cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> The Papiſts I grant ſtrengthen themſelues with ſuch places, to eſtabliſh their free-will, and to ſhew that our ſinnes are aboliſhed, and we redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the puniſhment of them, by our ſatisfactions. But this is but a brauado, without any ſubſtance: for the Prophet diſputes not heere about the cauſe of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but (as I haue ſaid) he onely ſhewes that men are growne too ſenſeleſſe and careleſſe, when they looke to bee in reſt,<note place="margin">Let him neuer dreame of reſt to himſelfe, that is at variance with God.</note> whileſt they haue warre with God, hee being armed to take vengeance on their iniquities. The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heere then is not, whether the ſinner may redeeme himſelfe out of Gods hands by repentance: The Prophet meant onely to ſay, <hi>we can looke for no ſafety nor tranquility vnleſſe God be appeaſed with vs:</hi> and therewithall alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, <hi>that God cannot ſhew himſelfe gracious, vnleſſe wee repent; yea and that in good earneſt, and from the pure affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards he adds, <hi>how long ſhall thy wicked thought
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7696:114"/> remaine in the middes of thee?</hi> Heere he taxeth the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of the Iewes, in ſaying, that whatſoeuer excuſes they pretend, yet they are <hi>conuicted before God,</hi> and that all their euaſions ſhould ſtand them in no ſtead, in regard God diues into the ſecreteſt imagination of the heart. Now he ſpeakes very pertinently, <hi>for he had to deale with hypocrites, who thought God tooke pleaſure in their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Moreouer, by oppoſing their cauils, they thought to haue been abſolued, in regard they could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before earthly Iudges. The Prophet ſcornes all theſe gauds, when he ſaith, <hi>How long ſhall thy vaine cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations remaine in thee?</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>albeit the whole world ſhould acquit and iuſtifie thee, what benefit ſhouldest thou reape by it? for thy vaine thoughts remaine ſtill in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of thee:</hi> that is, in the depth of thine heart. Now God ſees and diſcernes them, becauſe nothing is hid from his eyes.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hee calles them <hi>vaine cogitations:</hi> The Hebrew word ſometimes ſignifies a ſubſtance, and ſometimes vertue or power: alſo ſometimes it ſignifies griefe, and ſometimes vanity, or trouble. As touching this preſent place, I doubt not but it ſignifies, moleſtation, or vanity. For to expound it concupiſcenſe, as ſome doe, I ſee not how the word will beare it. But either of the two expoſitions which I haue ſet downe, will agree very well: although the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agrees yet beſt of all. How long then ſhall thy vaine thoughts remaine in the middeſt of thee; to wit, whereby thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. <hi>For in regard God held his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſuſpenſe, the Iewes verily thought they ſhould eſcape his hands.</hi> Moreouer, in regard <hi>of their effect;</hi> they were thoughts of <hi>moleſtation,</hi> and trouble.

But whatſoeuer we read heere in this verſe, repreſents (as it were) to the life, that calamity which was now at hand, in regard the Prophet ſets that before their eyes in figures, which could not bee expreſſed in bare words.

                     </note> now this was the vtmoſt City bordering vpon the North. And hee ſaid before, that from this part a plague ſhould come; that is to ſay, <hi>from the North,</hi> becauſe God had choſen the Chaldeans to be the executioners of his vengeance. For that cauſe he now ſaith, <hi>the voice may bee heard from Dan:</hi> not that the armie was now ready to giue the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet vpon the Iewes: but <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſpeakes heere by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of propheſie, as if he repreſented the iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the Iewes, which yet they thought would neuer haue come to paſſe.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7696:116"/> ouer the Prophets. For this cauſe <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſeeing he had to deale with blockiſh perſons; it was neceſſary for him <hi>to adorne his doctrine with ſuch figures as might euidently ſhew, that the iudgement of God was neere;</hi> which yet little affected the Iewes. He ſaith then, <hi>let the voice bee heard from Dan, and let trouble,</hi> or puniſhment, or calamity, <hi>bee publiſhed:</hi> for that other reading whereof I aduertiſed you, is very harſh, in regard the Hebrew word properly ſignifies Iniquity: but it is alſo fitly taken for puniſhment.

Calamity</hi> then, <hi>comes from mount Ephraim,</hi> which quarter was neareſt to the Tribe of Iudah, and to the City of Ieruſalem. But this is all one as if <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had ſaid, God now thunders from heauen: you ſhall therefore gaine nothing by ſtopping your eares: for albeit you are now deafe, yet ſhall Gods vengeance forthwith come to light, and that with the greater noyſe and aſtoniſhment.

Hee turnes his ſpeech <hi>towards the Gentiles</hi> then, and ſaith, <hi>Aduertiſe ye the Gentiles.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, it is a long while agoe ſince I admoniſhed this people: beſides, God hath ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them by other Teachers: but what hath all this profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vnleſſe that they are become ſo much the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable? Seeing the caſe ſtands thus then, <hi>Cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Gentiles now to know that which concernes Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>let the Iewes hence-forward heare no more of the calamity and ruine which must befall them; but let the Gentiles and profane nations take knowledge of thoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God which are to light vpon their heads.</hi> This expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not any way againſt the ſcope of the text, but is eaſie enough, and agrees very well with the Prophets manner of ſpeaking. Hee vouchſafes not then to direct his ſpeech to thoſe ouer whom God had placed him; for it had bin to haue caſt holy things to dogs: but he rather directs his ſpeech <hi>to the Gentiles:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>The blind and poore ignorant heathen haue more ſenſe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, than the people whom God himſelfe hath choſen.</hi> Neither doth this hinder, but the Prophet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill continued to exerciſe his office and function a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, and that for a long ſeaſon. For it is a thing vſuall and ordinary with the Prophets, being once inflamed with the zeale of Gods glory, to threaten the people with imminent deſtruction; and yet they ceaſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7696:117"/> not for all that, to goe on conſtantly in the diſcharge of their duties, proouing if by any meanes they might bring them home into the right way, who ſeemed in a manner, to haue been vtterly paſt recouery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe that beſiege thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall come from a farre countrey:</hi> they ordinarily turne it, the Keepers. Others thinking that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> alludes to <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> name; as if the guards of <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> came forth to ruinate and deſtroy Ieruſalem, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cities of Iudah. But as I thinke, it is better referred <hi>to beſiegers:</hi> which will be yet better cleared by the verſe following. Neither ſee I any reaſon why ſome ſhould tranſlate <hi>Guards:</hi> albeit the moſt (in a manner) are of this opinion. But I take it for thoſe that beſiege. <hi>The beſiegers</hi> then, <hi>ſhall come</hi> (ſaith he) and that <hi>from farre.</hi> This word <hi>farre,</hi> is expreſly added, to aſſure the people that they ſhould not eſcape, though God had patiently expected their repentance ſo long a time, as before we noted. For, becauſe God deferred his iudgements, they now thought themſelues paſt all feare of danger: and therefore now he ſaith, that howſoeuer they ſaw not the enemy approch with their eyes, nor heard not the noyſe of the armie in their eares; yet ſhall not Gods threatnings be in vaine: for <hi>out of a farre Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> can he cauſe ſuch to come, as ſhall be the executioners of his vengeance.</p>
                  <p>And therefore he adds, <hi>They ſhall ſend forth their cry vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cities of Iudah.</hi> This alſo was added for good cauſe, that the Iewes might thereby know, that no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment comming betweene, could ſtay the paſſage of the Chaldeans from ſurpriſing the Cities ſuddenly, by the voice of their cry. His meaning is indeed, of <hi>the cry which the ſouldiers make, the better to encourage one another to the battell:</hi> but in regard this often falles out, after they haue gotten the victory, to teſtifie their ioy and reioycing: he pronounceth definitiue ſentence vpon the Iewes, euen as if the ſouldiers were now making their <hi>cries of triumph.</hi> It followes.</p>

                  <p>I Dare not ſay, that that which ſome interpreters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is certaine or not; namely, that the Prophet is heere touched with humane paſſions, in regard hee ſaw ruine approch towards thoſe of his nation. It is very true indeed, that as oft as the Prophets denounce the heauie iudgements of God, and haue ſhewed themſelues to be ſeuere therein, that they haue not then caſt off all humane affections or compaſſion. For often they bewaile euen thoſe calamities which themſelues threaten: which wee ſhall alſo perceiue more clearly in fit place. Thus then the Prophets haue had a twofold paſſion: for when they are to be Gods heralds to proclaime his vengeance; they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> muſt then neceſſarily forget all humane paſſions: and yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſuch a magnanimity notwithſtanding hinders them not from retaining an inclination to ſhew compaſſion, as they are men: <hi>for it could not be auoided but their bowels must needs yearne within them, in ſeeing their brethren who were of their owne fleſh, to fall into ſuch ineuitable deſolations.</hi> But in this place it ſeemes the Prophet laments, not ſo much in reſpect of the peoples calamity, as that he meant to vſe certaine <hi>figures, whereby he might rouze vp and awaken the peoples dulneſſe, becauſe he ſaw they were growne altogether ſo ſenſeleſſe, as they were deſtitute of Gods true feare, neither could they be touched with any ſhame or bluſhing.</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7696:119"/> then being become thus peruerſe, <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and the reſt of Gods ſeruants, were conſtrained to vſe certaine ornaments and deckings of ſpeech, <hi>and not to teach after an ordinary mannner, but with violence and vehemency, that they might awaken the peoples drowzie conſciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this cauſe it is that he cries now, <hi>My belly, my belly paines me.</hi> For we ſhall ſee in other places where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet laments on this manner, when he hath to deale with Babylon, Edom, and others that were the Iewes enemies. And why? Sure it is the Prophet was not affected with any particular ſorrow, when he foreſaw their deſtruction; neither when God himſelfe had alſo ſhewed and aſſured him that the like ſhould befall the profane nations, who had with a deadly hatred perſecuted the elect and holy people. But as I haue ſaid, in regard men <hi>make ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of any of thoſe threats which he thunders from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; it is more than needfull to vſe ſuch forcible ſpeeches to rouze them withall. Thus I vnderſtand this place then, to wit, <hi>that the Prophet mournes not heere for the particular reſpect he had of the peoples calamitie; but being moued, yea and pricked forward by the ſpirit of propheſie; he now ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that by way of figure, which hee vttered before in plaine tearmes; becauſe he ſaw they regarded that but a little, or at leaſt it was inſufficient to touch them to the quicke. My bowels</hi> (ſaith hee). I grant that ſorrow might very well haue pierced <hi>euen into his bowels, in regard he was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame body:</hi> but we are heere to examine to what end this ſpeech is thus vttered. It ſerues not then, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a particular affection, <hi>but rather to diſcouer the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the puniſhment:</hi> that ſo the doctrine (as we haue ſaid) might touch their hearts, who ſcorned the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>troubled,</hi> or ſounds. For the word he heere v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſignifies to ſound: for which cauſe alſo, by way of ſimilitude, it is taken to make a tumult. He ſpeakes then of the trembling or beating of his heart, which is wont to happen by reaſon of ſome ſudden feare. But he calles it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7696:119"/> a ſound or tumult: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I am not maſter of my ſelfe, neither can I hold my ſelfe within compaſſe; for God hath affrighted me, with an horrible aſtoniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further he adds, <hi>I cannot be ſilent, becauſe my ſoule hath heard the ſound of the trumpet:</hi> or, <hi>becauſe thou my ſoule haſt heard the ſound of the trumpet,</hi> or, <hi>the alarme of the battell.</hi> For the Hebrew word heere vſed, ſignifies rather a battell. <hi>He ſaith then, hee cannot be ſilent, becauſe the cry ſounds and rings in his heart.</hi> Whence alſo we gather, that he is not touched with the ſenſe of humane affection; but rather doth that which God had enioyned him. For he was choſen as an <hi>herald of armes, to proclaime open warres as on Gods part, againſt the Iewes;</hi> whereof notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they made light account, though they heard the ſound of the alarme. Some thinke this word <hi>ſoule,</hi> is heere taken for the ſpirit of propheſie, in regard the trumpet now ſounded not, neither was the alarme of the battell as yet heard. Their opinion then is, that there is heere an antitheſis, in that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heard not the ſound of the trumpet with his eares, but onely conceiued the ſame in his heart, as being aduertized of Gods ſecret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But whether this ſubtilty will agree with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words or no, I know not. Mine opinion therefore is, that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> meant, without all peraduenture, to let them vnderſtand, that <hi>he ſpake ſeriouſly;</hi> in regard he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued Gods iudgement and vengeance as certainly to ſeaze vpon them, as if he had ſeene it before his eyes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this of ſmall importance, to giue ſo much the greater authority to his doctrine: that ſo the Iewes might know he was not like thoſe ſtage-players, who are skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough in repreſenting and playing their part whileſt they are vpon the ſcaffold, or ſtage, as if he meant onely to act that which God had cauſed him to ſee and know; but that he was his ambaſſadour in ſuch wiſe, <hi>that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was ſeized with feare, hearing in his ſpirit and heart the noyſe of the battell, and the ſound of the trumpet.</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>

                  <p>HE proſecutes the ſame argument ſtill; but hee am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies this terrour by a new circumſtance; namely, God ſo heapes <hi>euill vpon euill,</hi> that the Iewes ſhall <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully deceiue themſelues,</hi> if they hope that their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will ſone be at an end.

                  <p>But in ſaying the calamities <hi>are called,</hi> he giues them to vnderſtand, and that in few words, that God is ſet vpon his tribunall ſeate, who after he hath inflicted ſome light <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> chaſtiſements vpon men for their ſinnes, ſoone after adds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> more waighty puniſhments: &amp; laſtly, ſeeing them to grow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> deſperate in their rebellion, he alſo continues his ſtrokes ſo long, till at length he vtterly deſtroyes thoſe that will not amend. <hi>Affliction vpon affliction is called.</hi> But how? <hi>Truly becauſe the whole land is deſtroyed.</hi> And then, <hi>my tents are ſuddenly deſtroyed:</hi> Laſtly, <hi>my courtaines in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are caſt downe.</hi> The moſt receiued opinion is, that the Prophet heere compares the ſtrong and defenced Cities,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7696:120"/> to tents &amp; courtaines, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might take from the Iewes that fond confidence which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to burſt as it were with pride; thinking ſuch Cities ſhould ſerue them as bulwarks &amp; fortreſſes to repulſe their enemies. And thus they think the Prophet meant to depriue them of this vaine hope, in calling their ſtrong cities by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of tents or taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. There are others alſo who imagine, that he alludes to the city of Anathoth, the place of the prophets byrth, or to the maner of life which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> led there. And to ſay the truth, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> vſeth often ſuch phraſes of ſpeech as agrees to ſhepheards, and keepers of cattell: that is to ſay, ſuch a ſtile as is ſomewhat rude and diſ-ioynted: it ſhall not bee greatly amiſſe then, if wee ſay hee ſpeakes heere as in the perſon of a ſhepheard, when hee mentions theſe tents. Notwithſtanding both may ſtand very well; namely, that he ſpeakes like vnto ſhepheards, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of beaſts; and yet in the meane while hee meant to ſhew, that the Iewes did but dally, if they thought to eſcape vnder colour of thoſe ſtrong Cities which ſtood vpon their borders, as if thereby their enemies could bee beaten backe.

For what was more vnſeemly, than for <hi>Gods people,</hi> whom he hath choſen as his owne peculiar inheritance, <hi>to be void of knowledge and vnderſtanding?</hi> What elſe was Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in chuſing and adopting the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that they ſhould be <hi>as burning lights, to manifeſt the doctrine of ſaluation to all the world?</hi> What nation is there (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) ſo noble in all the world, to whom the gods come ſo neere, and ſo familiarly, as the Lord thy God doth? Herein conſiſts <hi>thy knowledge and wiſedome,</hi> as it followes in Deut. 4.6.7. Thus God here ſhewes, that it is a thing moſt prodigious, which all the world alſo ought to abhorre, when he giues <hi>his people</hi> heere the title of <hi>a fooliſh people.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Is it poſſible that this people whom I haue choſen to be a guardian of my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant touching euerlaſting ſaluation, to whom I haue vouchſafed the honour to inſtruct them by my word; is it poſſible I ſay, that this people ſhould be ſo inſenſible, as wilfully to caſt themſelues into perdition? <hi>It is a fooliſh people then, in regard they haue not knowne me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now heere he ſhewes what is the cauſe of <hi>this folly,</hi> to wit, <hi>they knew not God.</hi> For our whole wiſedome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the knowledge of God. But thus God lets them know that their folly is no way excuſable. Why ſo? He
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7696:122"/> made himſelfe ſo familiarly knowne vnto the Iſraelites, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, they needed not to aske, Who ſhall aſcend for vs into heauen? or who ſhall deſcend for vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth? For they had the word faſt by them, euen in their mouth, and in their heart, Deut. 30.12.13.14. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard then, that God had in ſo gracious a manner, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelfe vnto the Iewes, he iuſtly complaines, <hi>that they knew him not.</hi> Wee haue two poynts to note heere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then; firſt, God ſpecifies what this folly is, namely, that <hi>his people knew him not.</hi> Whence we haue to gather, that wee are then ſaid to be <hi>truly wiſe,</hi> when wee render to God his due honour; and are then iuſtly eſteemed <hi>fooles and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> whileſt we ceaſe to ſtay our ſelues in him. That is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one poynt. Moreouer, we ought to know that all pretenſe of ignorance heere falles to the ground, whileſt God thus manifeſted himſelfe to this people. And may not the ſame be ſaid vnto vs? Yes verily, God at the laſt day may iuſtly reproch vs, that we haue been <hi>fooles, and vnwiſe,</hi> if we haue not knowne him: for this is our wiſedome alſo, as I ſaid erewhile. Moreouer, here is no place to bring in any pretext of ignorance; for God hath not ſpoken to vs in ſecret. To be ſhort, God conuinceth the Iewes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and of wilfull malice in telling them <hi>they knew not.</hi> And we at this day deſerue (as I haue ſaid) a much greater condemnation, ſo as the puniſhment ought to be doubled, if we <hi>know him not,</hi> to whom God hath ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly reuealed himſelfe, and to whom in ſo gracious a manner he repreſents himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly he adds, <hi>that they are witleſſe, and without any ſenſe or vnderſtanding.</hi> The oppoſitions which are heere in the Hebrew text, haue greater waight than in the Greeke or Latine. In Greeke or Latine, this manner of ſpeech would haue little grace, if one ſhould ſay, This is a foole,<note place="margin">The Hebrewes haue their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> and not wiſe. For it ſeemes the latter member doth ſomewhat diminiſh that which was ſaid in the firſt. But the Hebrewes haue their manners of ſpeaking proper to themſelues: for thus they ſignifie, that this people is ſo
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7696:122"/> farre deſtitute of vnderſtanding, that there is <hi>not ſo much as a dramme of ſound knowledge in them.</hi> Thoſe who are fooles and witleſſe, will yet haue ſome ſparkes of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though neuer ſo ſmall: and thence came that prouerbe, That fooles often tell the truth. But <hi>Ieremiah</hi> on the contrary, meanes that the Iewes were not onely fooles and ſenſeleſſe, but ſo depriued of all iudgement and diſcretion, that they reſembled euen the inſenſible ſtones, or bruit beaſts: ſo as there remained neither wit, nor humane reaſon in them.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Prophet heere by ſundry ſorts of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, amplifies the terrour of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>that he might awaken the Iewes;</hi> who were become vtterly ſenſeleſſe and careleſſe. For he makes no idle repetitions, when foure times together he ſaith, <hi>he beheld.</hi> Hee might as well at once haue mentioned, <hi>the earth, the heauens, men, mountaines, and fruitfull places:</hi> but hee ſaith, that <hi>which way ſoeuer he turned his eyes, as if hee had viewed the foure quarters of the world; on euery ſide there appeared hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearful ſignes of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure, which threatned the Iewes with an vtter wast.</hi> Neither is it any maruell that the Prophet vſeth <hi>ſuch vehemency.</hi> For wee know with what contempt men are wont to entertaine all Gods threatnings, vnleſſe they bee indeed ſoundly awakened. Which manner of teaching ought not to bee ſtrange vnto vs. For hee that is but meanly read in the Prophets, may eaſily obſerue, that they inſiſt much vpon this poynt; to wit, in rouzing the hypocrites and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7696:123"/> of God: who as they haue a ſtiffe necke that will not bow; ſo according to the hardneſſe of their hearts, they will not be mooued with any puniſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they be threatened. But yet this place, among many other, is very notable: and therefore ought wee ſo much the more diligently to ponder that heere, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words import.</p>
                  <p>Firſt hee ſaith, <hi>hee beheld the earth.</hi> Hee vſeth the very ſame words which <hi>Moſes</hi> vſeth in the hiſtory of the worlds creation. For before the earth was formed, hee ſaith, it was a thing that lay waſt, and as a confuſed chaos,<note place="margin">Jeremiah al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to the Chaos of the world, before God made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of things therein.</note> without any forme or ſhape at all; as hauing no beauty in the face thereof, to allure the eyes of the beholders to gaze vpon it. It is as much then, as if hee had ſaid, Gods wrath and vengeance hath cauſed that diſtinct and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order ſo to vaniſh away; that nothing but an vtter confuſion remaineth. And thus he amplifies the outrage and enormitie of their ſinnes: as if hee ſhould ſay, They had ſo farre run riot, that thereby they had peruerted all the whole frame of the world, and (as it were) mingled heauen and earth together; ſo as nothing but an vtter vaſtation of all things appeared now euery where.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he ſaith, <hi>there was no light:</hi> he ſignifies, that the light of the Sunne and Moone was (in a manner) dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and put out; in regard men were vnworthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſuch a fauour as that is from God: <hi>as if the Sunne and Moone had been aſhamed,</hi> to be the witneſſes of ſo many foule iniquities. Wee haue now the ſumme of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets meaning as touching the firſt verſe. <hi>I looked</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>vpon the earth, and behold, I perceiued nothing but an horrible wracke and confuſion:</hi> that is, there was no forme nor diſtinction that might giue the beholders any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, becauſe the Iewes had ouerturned the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world (as it were) by their ſinnes. <hi>I</hi> alſo <hi>beheld the heauens, and there appeared no light in them:</hi> for the Iewes by their ſinnes deſerued to be depriued of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which he hath put in the Sunne, and in the Moone.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7696:124"/> For what a ſingular fauour of God is it, that he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſo noble and excellent creatures to doe vs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? In a word, the Prophet meant to ſay, <hi>that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſignes of Gods wrath, both in the heauens, and in the earth;</hi> thereby to terrifie the world, as if hee meant to make hauoke of all. This manner of ſpeech is alſo vſuall in the reſt of the Prophets, but eſpecially in <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.2. where there is a notable place to this purpoſe. And albeit they are hyperbolicall ſpeeches, yet doe they not exceed meaſure, if we conſider well what a dulneſſe and ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe there is in mans nature. For vnleſſe God arme <hi>the heauens and earth againſt vs;</hi> vnleſſe he manifeſt by ſome euident ſignes, that he is about to withdraw all his fauors from vs; what doe we elſe but ſcorne all his threatnings, as we ſaid erewhile?</p>

                     <hi>that the fruitfull regions were conuerted into deſerts:</hi> albeit I thinke hee ſpeakes properly heere of <hi>Carmel.</hi> For wee know that this quarter of the holy land was thus called, in regard of its fertility. I grant that <hi>Carmel</hi> of it ſelfe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies any fruitfull or fat ſoyle: but (as I haue ſaid) this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſo called, becauſe it abounded with all ſorts of fruits. For there were goodly paſtures; the fields there alſo yeelded great encreaſe; ſo as this quarter was euery way repleniſhed with all beauties aboue any of the reſt. You ſee the reaſon now why I willingly vnderſtand this place of <hi>Carmel</hi> it ſelfe: yea and I haue good warrant for it alſo: for in the next words it followes, <hi>that all the Cities were deſtroyed,</hi> it is more likely then, that this ſhould be ſpoken of <hi>Carmel</hi> in particular, then generally of all the regions and fruitfull places. For mine owne part, I thinke the Prophet ſpeakes of <hi>Carmel,</hi> yet ſo, as he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alludes to the ſignification of the word <hi>Carmel.</hi> In this verſe alſo there is a <hi>Synecdoch,</hi> a part taken for the whole: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Carmel,</hi> which excelled in all fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and abundance, yet became like a waſt wilderneſſe. When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes of the reſtauration of the Church, he ſaith, <hi>The deſert ſhallbe as Carmel:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.15.</note> Gods bleſſings ſhall be ſo generally and plentifully pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vpon the whole world, that the deſerts ſhall bee no leſſe fruitfull than <hi>Carmel</hi> it ſelfe; or the regions, which for their fatneſſe of ſoyle, excelled all others. But
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7696:125"/> 
                     <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſpeaking heere of the curſe, ſaith, <hi>that Carmel ſhall be as a wilderneſſe;</hi> and that all the Cities ſhall be laid waſt. Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe of the face of the Lord, and becauſe of the kindling of his ire.</hi> Others tranſlate, his furie: which manner of ſpeech hath his waight alſo. For we ſaid ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, that if God thunder not, as you would ſay, to ſtrike a terrour into mens hearts, they are all ſenſeleſſe, neither feele they his iudgements: ſo as all the threatnings in the world will profit them nothing at all. This is the cauſe why the Scripture ſo often ſpeakes of the <hi>fury</hi> or fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods wrath, or of the kindling of his ire. One of theſe might haue ſufficed. Why then puts he <hi>both,</hi> to wit, <hi>the inflaming</hi> of his <hi>wrath?</hi> Euen becauſe (as I haue ſaid) our obſtinacy and hard-heartedneſſe may be wonne, and broken as with the great blowes of an hammer: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God could not bow our hearts to his feare. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition then, ought to ſerue as a meanes to correct that rebellion which is in all of vs naturally. Not as if God were ſubiect to diſordered paſſions, as wee know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but in regard we cannot otherwiſe perceiue how fearfull his vengeance is; this is the cauſe why it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him neceſſarily to preſent himſelfe before our eyes as one <hi>angry, and inflamed with wrath and indignation:</hi> for which cauſe alſo we ſee that eternall death is repreſented out vnto vs <hi>vnder the metaphor of fier.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſumme of all.</note> As touching the ſumme and ſubſtance of this text, no doubt but the Iewes at this time enioyed abundance of all ſorts of good things, and were now plunged in their delights.

He denounceth then, <hi>as in the perſon of God,</hi> that there ſhall be a maruellous, yea, <hi>a moſt horrible deſolation, throughout the whole land of Iudeah. The land</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be vtterly deſolate:</hi> or, there ſhall be a deſolation throughout the land. Some expound that which followes, as if he ſomewhat allayed the tartneſſe and ſharpneſſe of his ſpeech. And according to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there ſhould be a correction heere, which ſhould (as it were) giue ſome reliefe vnto the faithful, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and waited to obtaine ſome grace and mercy, that they might not be vtterly out of heart. And to ſay the truth, if God ſhould onely threaten, without adding ſome exception; it were able to ſwallow vp with feare and dread, an hundred worlds. That the faithfull then might not in ſuch wiſe be ouer-whelmed with feare, as not to haue their recourſe to Gods mercy; it is often added by way of correction, that God will not vtterly conſume the earth. The word which the Prophet heere vſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſignifies, perfection, but in many other places, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies conſumption: for the verbe ſignifies, to perfect, and conſume. And there is the ſame reaſon for both: and yet it ſeemes theſe words ſhould be one contrary to another. Notwithſtanding that which is conſumed, may properly be called perfect, becauſe it alwayes brings to an end. If
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7696:126"/> this expoſition ſeeme good, then we now ſee why hee ſaith, That he will not make a conſumption, albeit he doe ſeuerely chaſtiſe this people: to wit, that he might leaue ſome hope for the faithfull, leſt they ſhould be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: which would haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, had not God promiſed to be ready to ſuccour them, and to be mindfull of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: vnleſſe peraduenture we will reade it by way of an interrogation, thereby to repreſſe the pride and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening of the wicked, that they might the better feele, how none of their vaine boaſtings ſhould goe vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. As if he ſhould ſay, And will ye yet ſay, that I will not make a full end? Now howſoeuer the firſt expoſition containes a doctrine much more ample: yet had I rather take the Hebrew word heere vſed, for <hi>End;</hi> as if he meant to ſhew, that he will not ceaſe to purſue them with his vengeance euen to the vttermoſt. Wee alſo ſhall meet with the ſame phraſe of ſpeech in the chapter following.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.27.</note> The naturall ſenſe then will be this, That God is purpoſed to waſt and conſume all at once. I grant when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpeake of Gods iudgements, they ſpeake thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly. Sometimes they will threaten that all ſhall goe to wrack, ſo as there ſhall bee no appearance of ſaluation. And yet God in the meane while alwayes reſerues ſome hidden ſeeds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.7.8.9.10. <hi>and</hi> 10.22.23.25.</note> as it is ſaid in the firſt, and tenth of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> From which places it is eaſie to iudge what the Prophets meant to ſay, by this manner of ſpeech, To make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. For in theſe places God threatens, that he will make a conſumption: and yet by and by after hee adds, this conſumption ſhall bring forth ſome fruit: that is to ſay, a remnant ſhall be exempt out of this conſumption. For in other places the Prophets compare the Church to oliues,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.6. <hi>and</hi> 24.13.</note> or oliue trees, when they are beaten or ſhaken: or to vines, at the time of vintage. For there will alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main one cluſter or other which cannot be eſpied, though all ſeeme to be gathered: the like alſo falles out when the oliue trees are ſhaken; for it is impoſſible but ſome oliues will alwayes remaine in the vpper part of the bowes. And
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7696:126"/> in the ſame manner God alſo ſaith, he will make ſuch a conſumption of his Church, as ſhall reſemble the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or the gathering of oliues, which yet are neuer ſo cleane ſtripped (as it were) of their fruit, but there will be ſome remainders, which ſhall not be eſpied. We haue now then (as I take it) attained the Prophets meaning: namely, that ſuch a ruine of the whole nation approcheth, as no mention at all ſhall afterwards be made of it: there ſhall be ſeene neither forme, nor beauty of it: which alſo in effect fell out, when they were led captiue into Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. For then the people (at leaſt in reſpect of the whole body) were brought (as it were) to nought. And thus there was no end.</p>
                  <p>I willingly confeſſe that Gods threatnings cannot be auailable to our ſaluation, vnleſſe he forthwith ſets before vs the hope of mercy: that being vpheld by this hope, we may haue our recourſe vnto him. For whileſt wee thinke God to be ſo angry againſt vs, that he will not be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we flee from him as much as we can. And this is the cauſe why deſpaire makes men fall into a diabolicall fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Thence alſo it comes to paſſe that the reprobates not onely murmure and gnaſh their teeth againſt God, and ſtorme and take on like bedlems; but they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly alſo caſt him downe from his ſeat. It is needfull then, that hope of pardon bee ſet before vs, that ſo wee may be touched with true repentance. And therefore in regard this promiſe is perpetuall; come what come will, yea albeit to our thinking heauen and earth will goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Pſal.</hi> 46.1.2</note> ſo as dangers of death ſhall ſeeme to preſſe vs on euery ſide: yet ought we alwayes to reſt confident in this beleefe, that there ſhall alwayes <hi>a reſidue remaine,</hi>

He ſpeaks not then, of the inhabitants of the earth. For thoſe which ſo expound it, doe very much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the vehemency of the Prophets words. He rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <hi>terrour and ſorrow heere, to the dumbe and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble elements;</hi> which is much more paſſionate, than if hee had plainly ſaid, The inhabitants of the earth ſhould mourne and lament. The ſame may bee ſaid alſo of the heauens. And indeed <hi>this latter member</hi> euidently ſhewes that he ſpeakes not of the inhabitants of the earth, <hi>but of the earth it ſelfe; which albeit it is vtterly without ſenſe or feeling, yet it ſeemes it hath a kind of feare and horror, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods vengeance.</hi> And thus the Prophet <hi>casts mens hard-heartedneſſe and ſenſeleſneſſe in their teeth,</hi> in that they were no whit moued nor ſmitten with any dread, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſaw ſignes of Gods wrath manifeſted againſt them <hi>from heauen. The earth</hi> then, <hi>ſhall mourne, and the heauens ſhall be darkened and troubled:</hi> that is, howſoeuer men remaine inſenſible, yet ſhall heauen and earth feele the horribleneſſe of Gods vengeance.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he adds, <hi>For I haue ſaid it.</hi> Some tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate this, as if a relatiue were to be ſupplied, betweene the two verbes: as if he had ſaid, <hi>For I haue ſaid, that which I thought,</hi> and I wil not repent. But this ſame abrupt manner of ſpeech ſutes well enough. For in the firſt place <hi>God pronounceth ſentence,</hi> which ſhall abide immutable and vnchangeable. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I haue once for all</hi>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:7696:127"/> ſignified by my faithfull ſeruants the Prophets, what I meant to doe. For the Prophets (as we know) were Gods heralds, to declare and publiſh his iudgements. And for as much as men for the moſt part, ſet light by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for as the world at this day is growne to that paſſe, that it proudly contemnes and ſcornes al the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that are denounced againſt it, ſo fell it out then. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> therefore <hi>brings in God himſelfe ſpeaking heere,</hi> as if he had ſaid, You haue deſpiſed my meſſengers, and yet haue they told you nothing, but what my felfe haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them. <hi>From me</hi> then, hath proceeded <hi>that ſentence</hi> which you for your parts ought to haue trembled at. See now in what ſenſe it is that God ſaith, <hi>I haue ſpoken.</hi> For he attributes that to himſelfe, which the Iewes thought came from the Prophets: and therefore they ſaw no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they might not freely ſet light by whatſoeuer the Prophets pronounced againſt them. <hi>It is I</hi> then, <hi>ſaith God, that hath ſpoken.</hi> And thus there ſhould be an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis betweene God, and the Prophets: as if hee ſhould ſay, The Iewes gaine nothing at all by ſnorting thus in their euils, whileſt they thinke they haue to doe with mortall men: whereas God himſelfe hath commanded and enioyned, his ſeruants to denounce the iudgement which they ſcorne ſo much. And yet leſt they ſhould I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, God ſpake onely to affright them with words full of wind (for hypocrites are wont to flatter themſelues vnder this pretext, that God ſpeakes not in good earneſt; but onely frayes men, as if he had to deale with little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) he ſaith alſo, <hi>I haue thought it.</hi> He ſaid before, <hi>hee ſpake,</hi> that is, as hauing reſpect to the Prophets; but now in ſaying he <hi>thought it;</hi> hee meanes, that the propheſies ſhall manifeſt their power, wherein God had threatned the Iewes with ruine, <hi>out of his owne ſecret counſell. This</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is decreed with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterward he adds, <hi>I repent not.</hi> In a word he ſhewes, that the Iewes <hi>are deſtinated to deſtruction,</hi> leſt they ſhould perſwade themſelues that God could bee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7696:128"/> whileſt they went on in their ſinnes: becauſe hee was determined to proceed in iudgement againſt them, and not onely ſignified the ſame <hi>by his Prophets;</hi> but had alſo concluded thereof <hi>in his owne breaſt.</hi> The word <hi>repentance</hi> is taken heere, for mutation or change. For God is not ſubiect to repenting, in regard all things are well enough knowne to him: but he ſpeakes after the manner of men, as I ſaid erewhile.<note place="margin">Repentance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God.</note> And that which followes, remooues away all ambiguity or doubt: for he ſaith, <hi>I will not turne away from it:</hi> that is, <hi>I will not call backe my ſentence.</hi> It followes.</p>

                  <p>That which followes, <hi>they ſhall aſcend into the clouds,</hi> or into the thickets, may bee expounded of the enemies: namely, they ſhall be ſo quicke and nimble, that they ſhall ſeeme to ſcale the clouds, and to get vp among the rocks: but I had rather reade it all with a breath thus, The Iewes ſhall be ſo affrighted and terrified in their flight, that no clouds ſhall be ſo high, to which they will not attaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tops of the higheſt mountaines are often ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer with groues and thickets, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ouerſhadowed. This place then may well be thus expounded; to wit, that they ſhall flee into groues and thickets where much wood is. How euer it bee, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet no doubt ſpeakes heere of places of great heighth: and thus this expoſition will be the more firme, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the word <hi>clouds.</hi> As touching the ſumme, we ſee wel enough what his meaning is; namely, that the enemie ſhal be of ſuch agility, that they ſhall outſtrip the Eagles by their nimbleneſſe, in comming to ſubdue and ouerthrow the ſtate of the Iewes: or, according to that which others thinke, which alſo is moſt receiued, <hi>The Iewes ſhall be put to their ſhifts in ſuch wiſe, that they ſhall not onely flee out of their Cities, but ſhall enter the tops of the higheſt mountaines, to hide themſelues there among the trees and buſhes, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the clouds.</hi> Alſo, <hi>they ſhall aſcend vp vnto the rocks.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe they ſhall not thinke themſelues otherwiſe in ſafety, in regard of the incurſions and aſſaults of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi>

                  <p>Finally he adds, <hi>That all the Cities ſhall bee ſo forſaken, that not ſo much as one inhabitant ſhall remaine therein.</hi> Thus we ſee how the Prophet ſtill aimes at the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Iewes, who had no eares to heare withall; whoſe hearts were now hearts of ſtone: ſo that they were not onely ſenſeleſſe of their euils, but fell to ſcorning both God and his meſſengers, euen as they had made a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with death, and hell, as it is ſaid in another place.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.11.</note> the Prophet reſpects <hi>the ornaments of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots;</hi> becauſe the people (as we haue often noted before) reſembled an adulterous woman,<note place="margin">

For God had couenanted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an holy mariage, which they had falſified. And thus ſuch a diſloyalty well reſembled <hi>a wanton wife,</hi> that hath broken the faith of wedlock. And becauſe ſuch kind of light huſwiues are wont <hi>to trim and paint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues after an whoriſh manner;</hi> the better to allure and draw louers by ſuch baits, vnto them: therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet now againe tels them, <hi>Thou ſhalt get nothing by dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy ſelfe, albeit thou ſhouldest clothe thee with ſcarlet; although thou ſhouldeſt gliſter all ouer with gold, euen from the crowne of the head, to the ſoles of thy feet; all this ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thee nothing at all. No, though thou ſhouldest paint thy ſelfe to the vttermoſt: this alſo ſhall ſerue thy turne no more than the former.</hi> As touching her louers, wee know who they were: namely, the Egyptians, and Aſſyrians. For the Iewes, feeling themſelues preſſed by the Egyptians, were wont to runne for helpe to the Aſſyrians: and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the Aſſyrians moleſted them, they went to require aide from the Egyptians. Which action of theirs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet compares to the cunning deuices and ſhifts of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots: for in gadding thus to and fro, from one to another; what did they elſe but violate that ſacred band of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which was contracted betweene God and them; falſifying their faith which they had plighted vnto him. Thus then the Prophet ſaith, Although the Egyptians promiſe thee mountaines, as it falles out with ſome luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full louer, that is entiſed by the beauty and painting of an

                     <hi>IEremiah</hi> by theſe words yet further confirmes that which we ſaw before: for he inciſts not thus long vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter onely for teaching ſake; but becauſe hee ſaw thoſe of his nation grew obſtinate, and had hearts as hard as the Adamant. This is the cauſe why with <hi>ſo many words</hi> he inculcates, and with ſuch diuerſities of ſpeech <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats,</hi> one and the ſame thing: which he could not haue deliuered ſo well in plaine tearmes, nor in a word or two. For oft times the doctrine will little auaile, vnleſſe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and threatnings bee added thereunto. You ſee now to what end, and for what cauſe hee ſo often, and in ſo many words repeates one and the ſame thing: alſo why he hath expounded that at large, which we ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>heard a voice, as of her that trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</hi> Doubtleſſe this muſt bee taken otherwiſe than the words ſound: for it is certaine that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was no quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of hearing than the reſt: vnleſſe wee would ſay, that being mounted vpon an high turret, he ſaw Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approching a farre off (whereof the people at that time made but ſlight reckoning) that he might repreſent the ſame out vnto others. He ſaith then, that <hi>he heard,</hi> and that no leſſe plainly, than if the thing had been preſent before him.</p>
                  <p>He further amplifies the matter, by a word which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>anguiſh:</hi> and then in ſtead of a woman <hi>that hath had a child,</hi> he puts a woman that trauels <hi>of her firſt borne; where the ſorrow is greater. Ieremiah</hi> ſhewes then, that this people which could not bee reclaimed from their ſinnes,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7696:131"/> ſhould ſhortly fall into an horrible and extreame miſery. But withall he ſecretly intimates (as alſo the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes in other places) that the ruine which was to come, ſhould ſuddenly come: for when they ſhould ſay, Peace and ſafety, then ſhould ſudden deſtruction fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, 1. Theſ. 5.3. So likewiſe the Prophet in this place ſhewes, that the Iewes ſhall get nought by ſtanding in their obſtinate courſes againſt God; as if therefore the iudgement were the further off from them: for <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhould ſuddenly ouertake them: as the labour comes vpon a woman that is iocund, who eates and drinkes merrily; but yet the ſorrowes of her trauell will not ceaſe for all that, to take her ſuddenly in the necke. Euen ſo our Prophet aduertiſeth the Iewes, that they ſhould not thinke to put backe Gods vengeance by their fond confidence and ouer-weening: becauſe the plague ſhould ſurprize them, and they ſhould feele their ruine ere they were aware.</p>
                  <p>And yet (as I haue ſaid) hee expreſſeth their calamity vnder ſimilitudes, and borrowed ſpeeches. <hi>The voyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the daughter of Sion ſhall lament,</hi> or bewaile her caſe. Some tranſlate in the ſecond perſon, <hi>Thou ſhalt lament, and ſhalt ſpread, or wring in pieces thine hands:</hi> but this cannot well agree, becauſe it by and by followes, <hi>her hands,</hi> in the third perſon. He ſaith then, that <hi>the voice</hi> of the daughter of Sion ſhall witneſſe her great dolour and affliction, becauſe <hi>ſhee ſhall lament.</hi> And forthwith adds, <hi>the ſmiting of the hands:</hi> for the expoſitors tranſlate the words diuerſly. But in regard the Hebrew word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies properly to rend and teare in pieces, or diuide; I thinke the Prophet meant to expreſſe <hi>the geſtures of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is in labour.</hi> For they are wont thus to ſmite their hands one againſt another, and to diuide and intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle their fingers one within another. Others tranſlate, They ſpread, in regard the hands are (as it were) cut or diuided, when they are thus lifted or holden vp in the ayre. As touching the matter it ſelfe, the Prophets mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7696:131"/> is not obſcure: for he foreſeeth that God will ſend an horrible iudgement, <hi>ſo as the Iewes ſhall lament after an extraordinary manner, as women are wont to doe that are brought into ſome deſperate extremity,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, he concludes his ſpeech, ſaying, <hi>Woe is me now my ſoule fainteth, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet meant heere to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them, that howbeit they were all as blind as bats at noone day, <hi>yet he apparantly perceiued Gods iudgements,</hi> whereat they fleered and laughed; or at leaſt the wicked made but a ſport of them. He ſaith, <hi>his ſoule fainteth,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe which were ſlaine; <hi>and yet none were killed.</hi> But by this phraſe of ſpeech he teſtifies, that he already ſaw thoſe things which were ſecret and vnknowne (as it were) before his eyes, which made them to be ſo little moued at them.</p>

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7696:133"/> naughty-packes bragged that God was on their ſide. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> (as we ſhall ſee afterwards) <hi>had many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conflicts with the falſe Prophets.</hi> For there were great troupes of them, with which for the moſt part, the world is alwaies peſtered, <hi>the whole eſtate of the Prieſthood was corrupted, and waged battell of ſet purpoſe euen againſt God himſelfe.

                  <p>THis is added by way of anticipation; and (as you would ſay) to preuent the Iewes, becauſe (as it is well knowne) they thought to haue the <hi>name of God</hi> (which went glib the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery ones mouth) as a ſufficient couert for their vices. For as much then, as they openly vaunted that they ſerued the God of <hi>Abraham;</hi> they thought all their wickedneſſes might well be winked at, in regard of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7696:134"/> this pretext. Now the Prophet <hi>meets with this conceit,</hi> and ſhewes that ſuch figge leaues are nothing worth, becauſe they onely profaned the name of God with their abuſes of it. Moreouer, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> alſo <hi>aggrauates the fault of the Iewes:</hi> for he ſhewes that they were vtterly eſtranged from Gods true feare; not onely in their whole courſe of life; but albeit ſome kind of <hi>religion</hi> remained amongſt them, yet euen that alſo was meere ſacriledge. It is bad enough when Gods name is buried in obliuion, and when wretched men giue themſelues the raines to commit euil, as if they could eſcape away with it in the darke. But how odious and deteſtable is ſuch a wickedneſſe, when they dare thus of ſet purpoſe, prouoke God euen to his face? It is this then, which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> heere notes, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſay, Iehouah liues, yet</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>they ſweare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> falſly.</hi> Now we ſee the Prophets meaning. For in the firſt place, hee pluckes the vizard of this vaine confidence from off the faces of the hypocrites, in regard they thought God would eaſily be entreated, if ſo be they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>pretended his name.</hi> And yet they conſidered not how pretious the name of God was: and thus they cared not lightly to take vp the ſacred name of God in vaine. Now the Prophet not onely condemnes the hypocriſie of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Iewes, but (as I haue ſaid) he aggrauates their fault, in regard they made no conſcience in proſtituting the holy name of the Lord to all purpoſes, and to be at vtter defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it. For this is done, when wee abuſe the name of God, by <hi>vaine ſwearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he ſaith, <hi>Although they ſweare, &amp;c.</hi> he vſeth here the ſame word which the faithfull vſe in their oathes: for when they call the liuing God to witneſſe, it is as much as if they preſented themſelues before his iudgement ſeat, as being well aſſured, <hi>that howſoeuer God may deferre his vengeance for a time, yet muſt they come to an account, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he alwayes liues.</hi> Thus the faithfull acknowledge, that if they forſweare themſelues, they can gaine nothing by it, though God ſhould ſuſpend his iudgement. But (as I
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7696:134"/> haue already ſaid) the Prophet referres this to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who ſeemed to honour God much: for nothing hath a goodlier ſhew than their words. But gall is in their hearts, whileſt they haue theſe ſugred words in their lips. The Prophet then <hi>derides</hi> this fained holineſſe, when he ſaith; that in outward ſhew they ſware very demurely, as though they affected nothing more than piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; <hi>yet for this they will ſweare.</hi> Others tranſlate, truly, or certainly: but the ſenſe will be plainer, if we tranſlate, <hi>for this,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>for this thing,</hi> or for this cauſe, <hi>they will ſweare falſly,</hi> or lyingly.

But <hi>Ieremiah</hi> proſecutes his former argument ſtill. For the diſtinction of the verſes is of no moment, in this behalfe. Whoſoeuer hath thus diſtinguiſhed them, hath often peruerted and corrupted the ſentences: wee muſt winke at this fault then: onely for the helpe of memory we are to retaine the number. But as touching the ſcope of the text, the obſeruation thereof often hinders the readers: for things ſeparated one from another, are for the moſt part confuſed; yea, and that which was very well knit together, ſhall we find diſ-ioyned. I often think hereupon, and it is alſo a profitable aduertiſement: as in this place, after the Prophet hath ſhewed how the Iewes were diſloyall, and of a double heart, void of all vprightneſſe, he adds, <hi>yet doe thine eyes O Lord, behold the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7696:135"/> right,</hi> or truth. As if he ſhould ſay, it is in vaine for them to pretend the name of God, or to ſhelter themſelues vnder heapes of ceremonies, or outward appearances of godlineſſe, <hi>for God ſoundeth the heart and reynes;</hi> he ſtands not vpon vizards of holineſſe, wherewith mens eyes are blinded and bleared. Furthermore, the Prophet thus <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly directs his ſpeech to God,</hi> the better thereby to ſhew how irkſome his trauels were vnto him, when he ſaw his preaching did ſo little good, among ſo headſtrong a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For had the Iewes in any meaſure been tractable or teachable, no doubt he would rather now (vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe) haue exhorted them to integrity and vprightnes. He might very well haue ſaid thus, Thoſe were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, who in ſwearing by the name of God, perſwade themſelues that he will therefore be their father:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>for his eyes behold the truth,</hi> and the vprightneſſe of the heart. This had been (you ſee) to good purpoſe, and it had alſo been an apt manner of teaching: but <hi>Ieremiah breakes off his ſpeech,</hi> as it were abruptly, <hi>and leauing the people, turnes him to God: Lord</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are not thine eyes vpon the truth?</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>What doe I any further trouble my ſelfe about this deſperate people? I ſpeake, but it is as if it were to a rocke; or to a ſtone wall. Fare you well therefore, I haue done with you: I will now another while make my mone to God.</hi> Now we ſee that this<note n="*" place="margin">A turning of ones ſpeech from thoſe that are preſent, to ſome abſent.</note> 
                     <hi>apoſtrophe, hath much more vehemency in it, than if the Prophet had ſtill ſpoken to the Iewes without intermiſſion;</hi> performing the office of a teacher vnto them. For thus he ſhewes, that his head and heart was broken with this tedious courſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his words ſo little to preuaile, and all of them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to whom hee preached, to bee ſtubborne and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Neither yet did he caſt foorth this ſpeech raſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ayre, as if it had been to no purpoſe: but by this meanes he rather meant with the greater eagerneſſe, <hi>to pricke forward</hi> theſe dull ſcholers of his, whom hee ſaw thus to lagge behind; for otherwiſe hee was (as it were) hopeleſſe, that he ſhould euer procure their good. Wee
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7696:135"/> are to call to minde then,<note place="margin">See for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Maſter Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins preface be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Iſaiah, the latter end.</note> that which elſewhere I haue touched, namely, that the Prophets preached not word for word as they haue written: but after they haue ſtood long vpon a poynt before the people, they then gathered the ſumme afterwards. And thence came the bookes of the Prophets. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> therefore no queſtion, had at large handled the doctrine of repentance; had earneſtly inueyed againſt the hypocrites; had diſcouered the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent courſes of his nation; and had alſo ſharply repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their obſtinacie. But after all this, it was needfull hee ſhould <hi>make a ſtop as it were, in the midway,</hi> in regard hee well foreſaw that little fruit would redound to him by his painfull labours. And the Iewes alſo being priuie to this, it ſtood him in hand to touch them ſo much the more, to the quicke. For doe we not ſee how wee at this day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the ſpirit of God by our rebellion, in regard it is ſo horrible a monſter? Nothing therefore ought more to wound vs to the heart, than the ſame. What a thing is it? God calles vs familiarly to him euery day: but when hee ſees our hearts ſo hard, and that we hold vp our heads ſo high; <hi>there he leaues vs,</hi> becauſe we grieue his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he ſaith in Iſa. 63.10. <hi>An ordinary or common courſe of teaching heere then, would not ſerue the turne: but there was need of more efficacy now to be added to his teaching, when he ſaw the wickedneſſe of his nation was become intolerable. Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are not thine eyes vpon faith,</hi> or truth.</p>
                  <p>Now when he ſpeakes <hi>thus to God,</hi> there is an antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis betweene God and men. For we know that the worſt ſort of people in the world are pleaſed well enough, whileſt they may haue the good opinion and eſtimation of men like themſelues. Whileſt they are ſo eſteemed then, they lie ſnorting in their vices. The Prophet derides this fooliſh confidence, and ſhewes that God ſees other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than mortall man doth. For man ſcarcely can looke the length of three fingers from him: but God diueth into the very bottome and depth of the heart. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet then ſo ſpeakes of <hi>Gods eyes,</hi> that in reſpect thereof
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7696:136"/> he ſhewes mens iudgements are friuolous, in regard they ſeeke after nothing but faire ſhewes, and vaine appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. By the word <hi>faith,</hi> as alſo in the firſt verſe of this chapter, the Prophet meanes the integrity of the heart. They erre from the marke then, who to ſhew their wit, endeauour to prooue, from this place, that we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by faith onely. <hi>For the Prophet ſpeakes not heere of that faith by which wee embrace free reconciliation with God; by which alſo we are made the members of Ieſus Christ.</hi> The ſenſe then is plaine enough of it ſelfe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God eſteemes not outward ſhewes, wherewith men are delighted, as it is in 1. Sam. 16.7. <hi>Man lookes to the outward appearance; but God regards the heart.</hi> By the word <hi>heart</hi> there, the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth the ſame thing which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> meanes <hi>by faith, or truth heere.</hi> For <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhewes, that <hi>Dauids</hi> father deceiued himſelfe in bringing forth thoſe ſonnes firſt, which were of the moſt comely ſtature and perſonage. <hi>Man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>lookes to the outward forme; but God ſees the heart.</hi> Now wee haue the true and naturall ſenſe of the Prophets words; to wit, after the hypocrites ſhall haue flattered themſelues to the full, and that all the world ſhould haue applauded them therein; yet all this ſhall ſerue them to no purpoſe: for in concluſion, they muſt all be ſummoned before the barre of Gods iudgement ſeate. Now in his preſence, <hi>nothing but truth</hi> hath place, neither is any thing elſe precious in his ſight.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>Thou haſt ſmitten them, but they haue not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.</hi> Here the Prophet reprooues the obſtinacy of the people, in that being ſmitten of God, yet they amended not.<note place="margin">Prouerbes,</note> For experience (as they ſay) is the miſtriſſe of fooles. It is alſo a prouerbe, as true as ancient, that fooles become wiſe by their harmes and loſſes. The Heathen Poets, and Hiſtoriographers doe often vſe theſe ſentences. Since then the Iewes were of ſo ſtubborne and rebellious a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they gained nothing, <hi>no not by the ſmart of the ſtripes with which they were ſmitten;</hi> it was a ſigne they
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7696:136"/> were altogether incurable. The Prophet heere then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes vnto the former ſentence, where God ſaid, hee would ſpare this people, if an honeſt and vpright man could be found in the whole City. This the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes when hee ſaith, <hi>Thou hast ſmitten them, but they haue not ſorrowed.</hi> No doubt but the Iewes ſorrowed; yea and howled alſo, vnder the blowes, and were but too skilfull in making their complaints. For wee ſee with what an heighth of pride they deſpited God himſelfe. <hi>They ſorrowed then:</hi> but the word <hi>ſorrow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They ſorrowed, but it was not a ſorrow accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God. <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>7.11.</hi>
                     </note> is heere taken <hi>ſtrictly:</hi> as where <hi>Paul</hi> handles the doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he ſhewes, that the beginning thereof conſiſts in ſorrow. So in this place the Prophet denies, that thoſe who had confuſed thoughts in their minds, did therefore ſorrow rightly: <hi>for they felt not that they had to deale with God.</hi> By this word then, hee ſignifies as much as another Prophet doth, who ſaith, <hi>they looked not to the hand of him that ſmote them,</hi> Iſa. 9.13. For his meaning is not, that they were ſo brutiſh or blockiſh, as not ſenſibly to feele the blowes: but in the meane while, they neglected the hand of God, from whence they came. Now this ought chiefly to be reſpected in our ſorrow: for although wee howle with a blind outrage, proceeding from the ſenſe of our miſeries; hauing this word <hi>Alas,</hi> neuer ſo much in our mouthes, what of all this? Theſe are onely the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and rorings of bruit beaſts. But when wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>hand that ſmiteth;</hi> that is the true and right framed ſorrow. In this ſenſe <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſaith, the Iewes <hi>ſorrowed not, becauſe they felt not that God had iuſtly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed them with his hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next words he amplifies this doctrine, <hi>Thou haſt conſumed them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and they refuſed to receiue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>they were conſumed,</hi> it is a ſigne of a deſperate rebellion. For if God touch vs but lightly, no maruell, if (according to our ſlowneſſe and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) we be not forthwith awakened. But if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double his blowes; yea, that hee not onely ſcourgeth vs
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7696:137"/> with his rods, but alſo drawes forth his fiery ſword, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to conſume vs: when he deales thus with vs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes his vengeance by horrible and fearfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;<note place="margin">When God dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and we how not vnder them, it is a ſigne that the diuell hath beſotted vs.</note> if then (I ſay) <hi>we be yet ſenſeleſſe,</hi> vnder ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and feele not how hidious a thing it is to fall into his hands: it may well be concluded, <hi>that the diuell hath blinded and bewitched vs.</hi> This benummedneſſe that was in the Iewes, the Prophet now bewaileth, in regard they were not onely <hi>void of feeling the ſtripes whileſt God ſmote them;</hi> but that <hi>they receiued no correction, albeit he conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them.</hi> In this ſecond member he toucheth that which I formerly told you; namely, that this ſorrow whereof he ſpake, muſt not be taken generally, but for that true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which ſets Gods iudgement in ſuch wiſe before vs, that we learne to tremble thereat.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>that they hardened their faces like a ſtone:</hi> in a word, <hi>that they would not returne.</hi> The Prophet ſignifies, that the Iewes were not onely <hi>rebellious,</hi> but alſo growne <hi>ſhameleſſe.</hi> And although they had ſhewed all the ſignes of ſhame that poſſibly they could; yet all had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, vnleſſe the integrity of the heart had gone before, as we haue ſaid. But it often falles out, that euen the moſt wicked being full of impiety; of the contempt of God, and rebellion alſo: will yet be ſmitten with ſome ſhame and remorſe. But the Prophet (to ſhew that the Iewes were growne to the heighth of all impiety) ſaith, <hi>they hardened their faces:</hi> that is to ſay, they were vtterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, in regard they had reiected all honeſty, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene good and bad, of iuſtice and equity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute then, of all <hi>humane ſenſe;</hi> hee therefore ſaith, nothing now remaines, but that God (according as hee had foretold) muſt of force execute <hi>his laſt iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> And hee repeates that which hee ſaid, when hee ſaith, <hi>they refuſed to returne.</hi> For hee ſignifies, that they ſinned not now through errour or ignorance, neither were they gone aſtray through weakneſſe: but that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and of ſet purpoſe, they caſt off all care of their
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7696:137"/> ſaluation, and witttngly had forſaken the Lord, ſo as they would ſuffer <hi>neither his word nor workes</hi> to take any place in them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas ſome thinke the Prophet heere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth his nation, and as much as in him is, leſſens their fault; they are groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For doubtleſſe by this compariſon he makes it yet more euidently appeare, that things at that time were growne deſperate. The ſumme is this; Corruptions raigned then, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the common people, but euen among the great ones alſo; ſo as from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of the foot, nothing was ſound amongſt them, as they ſay. There is a ſentence ſomewhat like to this, in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> although in other words, Chap. 28.7.8. For hauing there firſt inueyed againſt the whole nation in generall, he tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the gouernours alſo: <hi>You</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are no leſſe drunke than the common people.</hi> I grant he affirmes it is through wine and ſtrong drinke: but the meaning is, that they were all become like drunkards, in regard they were paſt ſhame; whileſt (without any modeſty at all) they gaue ouer themſelues to the committing of all villanies and abominations. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> hath the ſame drift heere, when he ſaith, <hi>I thought, ſurely they are of the poorer ſort,</hi> and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7696:138"/> thoſe of ſmall reckoning, that haue thus ſinned; but I found euen the <hi>Gouernours</hi> alſo guilty as well as they. He might in a word haue ſaid, Not onely thoſe of the common and baſer condition are corrupt; but the chiefe alſo, and thoſe that ſhould haue giuen good example to the reſt. But this <hi>compariſon</hi> hath farre greater waight, when he ſaith, <hi>It may be thoſe that haue thus failed are ſome of the poore ones, who are ignorant of the Law of God. And what maruell? But out of doubt we ſhall find greater inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity in the Gouernours.</hi> When the Prophet ſpeakes thus then, hee brings the readers to the view of the preſent fact as it were, and ſhewes that they were none of the raſcality that had ſinned; but they were the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, and thoſe of the chiefeſt ranke.</hi> The Prophets meaning is plaine enough. <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>not that hee thought thus:</hi> for he ſaw all things were out of ſquare, and that there was no more good to be hoped for of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, than of the gouerned. The Prophet knew all this full well: but (as I ſaid before) he meant to ſhew, as in a liuely image, how miſerable the condition <hi>of the whole nation</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>certainly:</hi> the word heere vſed in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, ſerues either for an affirmation, or for a particle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſatiue, <hi>Although,</hi> as wee ſaw in the third verſe. Some take it in this place for <hi>peraduenture.</hi> It is put heere by way of yeelding ſo much, Put the caſe (ſaith he) that they are thoſe of the baſer and beggerlier ſort that haue ſinned thus: I wonder not that they haue carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thus fooliſhly, <hi>for they haue not knowne the way of the Lord, nor the iudgement of their God.</hi> The Law indeed was manifeſted <hi>to all indifferently,</hi> ſo as the common ſort were without excuſe: but this ſickneſſe hath raigned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all ages, that few haue been attentiue to the law: for who is it that doth not willingly reiect this yoke? Now thoſe of the meaner ſort thinke to be ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, becauſe they want leiſure to ſtudy; neither are they borne to any great matters. The Prophet then frames
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7696:139"/> his ſtile according to the manner of men: and yet he leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens not the fault, if any would haue pretended ignorance. As, Oh ſir, <hi>I was neuer at the ſchooles.</hi> For as we haue ſaid, God publiſhed his Law for the good of the whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the way of the Lord, and by the iudgement of God,</hi> the Prophet ſignifies one and the ſame thing. It is a repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, a thing very vſuall with the Hebrewes. For when God preſcribes vs <hi>the rule of a good life,</hi> it is as much as if he ſhewed vs <hi>the way.</hi> For our life reſembles a race: now God would not haue vs to runne at randome; but ſets vs vp a certaine marke. He alſo leades vs by a certaine way; becauſe it is the office of the Law to call vs from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring aſtray,<note place="margin">The office of the Law.</note> and to leade vs to the marke that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs. For this cauſe the Law is called <hi>the way of the Lord:</hi> but <hi>iudgement,</hi> as we heard yeſterday, ſignifies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, or a rule. He puts <hi>the way of the Lord</hi> in the firſt place; and <hi>the iudgement of God</hi> in the ſecond. And thus he ſhewes,<note place="margin">Such as liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance, he they neuer ſo meane or ſimple.</note> that ſuch as eſteeme themſelues poore idiots that know nothing, are yet without excuſe. For God meant no leſſe to teach them, the right way, than the moſt learned in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now he adds in verſ. 5. <hi>I will goe to the great ones.</hi> By the <hi>great,</hi> hee vnderſtands as well the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> as the <hi>Kings councell;</hi> yea, the <hi>King himſelfe. I will goe then to the great ones, and ſpeake to them:</hi> which is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>I know I ſhall but looſe my labour, which way ſoeuer I goe: for they are all not onely deafe, if I direct my ſpeech to the poore commons; but euen they among the gouernours alſo.</hi> I told you erewhile, that the Prophet conſults not in himſelfe as of a thing doubtfull; but as one meaning to ſhame euen the greateſt. Which he alſo doth, the better to confirme his former ſpeech; namely, That there was not an vpright man to be found in all the City of Ieruſalem.<note place="margin">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7696:139"/> Prophet was otherwiſe perſwaded in his mind: but hee ſpeakes as of a thing likely. For who would almoſt haue imagined, that at that time, there had been ſuch brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the heads and gouernours. For I tell you they were wonderfully admired amongſt the people. This conceit then going for currant, to wit, that all ſuch as then had the command ouer the people, were men well exerciſed in the Law of God: <hi>Ieremiah ſpeakes now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this receiued opinion,</hi> doubtleſſe <hi>they haue knowne the way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>But they haue broken the yoke, and burſt the bands;</hi> that is, if any ſuppoſeth the heads and gouernours are any whit better than the commons, hee failes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: for I know well enough how the world goes with them. <hi>They alſo,</hi> haue as well broken Gods yoke, as the moſt ignorant among the rude multitude. By this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petion,</hi> he yet better confirmes the certainty of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt; and withall ſhewes how vnworthy a thing it was that the Prophets, Prieſts, and Iudges, who had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all, were ſo diſſolute and vnbridled in their luſts.

                     <hi>IEremiah</hi> now at length ſhewes, that God keepes ſuch meaſure in his iudgements, that the caſt-awayes ſhall in vaine accuſe him of ouermuch ſeuerity, though it bee vſuall with them ſo to doe. Some tranſlate theſe words as if that which is heere ſaid, had been already effected;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7696:140"/> and thinke the ſenſe to be this, namely, that the Prophet reprocheth the Iewes; ſhewing it was not without cauſe they had been chaſtiſed with ſo many calamities, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they had iuſtly deſerued as many more. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe ſutes alſo very well. For we know how the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes are wont to change the tenſes of verbes: and for mine owne part, I willingly referre it to the time to come, becauſe it ſeemes the Prophet makes not a narration of that which they had formerly ſuffered; but how ſharpe the afflictions were, which immediatly ſhould befall them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lion of the forreſt</hi> then, <hi>ſhall ſmite them.</hi> As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words, we told you that <hi>the Wolfe of the deſerts,</hi> is as much as the wolfe comming out of the deſert. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others expound it the wolfe of the night or euening, it may alſo ſtand. For in other places we know that hunger-ſtarued wolfes, are called wolfes of the night; in regard they hauing ſought their prey all the day long, and not meeting therewith, are almoſt mad in the euening: thus hunger makes them range here and there. This expoſition then may paſſe: but hauing ſaid before, that the Lion came out of the forreſt, it is more likely he alſo deſcribes the wolfe comming out of the deſert. And as touching the ſumme, the difference is not great.</p>
                  <p>He names <hi>three beaſts</hi> heere, <hi>A Lion, a Wolfe, and a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard.</hi> No doubt but by theſe beaſts, <hi>vnder a metaphor, he meanes the enemies which ſhould ſhortly inuade the land with great cruelty.</hi> True it is, that before <hi>Ieremiah</hi> made this Sermon, the Iewes had already ſuffered many calamities: for God reuenged not himſelfe vpon them, all on one day; but he often aduertiſed them: and had there been any hope of amendment left, hee would yet haue ſaued them, becauſe their condition had been to be pitied. But it ſeemes <hi>Ieremiah</hi> propheſieth heere, of iudgements to come: and therefore hee not onely vnderſtands by theſe beaſts, <hi>the Aſſyrians,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians; but all other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies alſo.</hi> For we know that this nation was hated mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7696:140"/> of all their neighbours, and cruelly vexed with iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, euen by thoſe of their<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>owne blood.</hi> In regard then, ſo many nations hated the poore Iewes, it is no maruell if the Prophet numbers vp <hi>three ſorts</hi> of beaſts heere. As if he ſhould ſay, Enemies will inuade you on euery ſide, who like <hi>Lions, Wolfes, and Leopards, will exerciſe their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cruelty vpon you,</hi> becauſe you haue ſo often, ſo many waies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and ſo long a time together, prouoked the Lord to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In the meane while, God heere reiects the falſe and peruerſe complaints which the wicked were ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp; anon to make againſt him: ſhewing, that he is their iuſt iudge; and that the puniſhments and chaſtiſements which he inflicted vpon the Iewes, were not to bee taken in ill part. And hitherto appertaines that particle, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> or, becauſe.</p>
                  <p>He adds, that <hi>the Leopard watcheth to rend all thoſe in pieces that come out of the Cities.</hi> Doubtleſſe hee ſignifies by this ſimilitude, that after the enemie hath inuaded the land, <hi>the Iewes ſhall be ſo incloſed and ſhut vp within their Cities, that they ſhall not dare to peepe out, becauſe dangers from euery part, ſhall appeare vnto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the end of the verſe hee repeats againe, and more largely proſecutes that which he vnderſtood by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, <hi>And therefore; or becauſe.</hi> For hee ſaith, <hi>becauſe their iniquities are multiplied, and their reuolts encreaſed.</hi> By theſe words he ſhewes yet better, that which he touched before; to wit, that God is a iuſt iudge, euen then when he ſeemes to be moſt ſeuere: for it was impoſſible that this ſo deſperate a people ſhould eſcape without ſome ſtrange iudgement inflicted vpon them from God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names he them ſimply <hi>wicked ones, or Apoſtataes,</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>their iniquities,</hi> or wickedneſſes <hi>were multiplied, and their reuolts augmented. And by this latter word, hee aggrauateth their condemnation.</hi> For albeit the firſt word ſignifies not onely to faile, but to doe <hi>wickedly:</hi> yet to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from God,</hi> is a crime much more odious and hatefull. Whence wee gather, that the Iewes are heere charged
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7696:141"/> with ſo great a peruerſity, that it was not to bee chaſtiſed with ordinary or light remedies. It followes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For thy children haue forſaken me:</hi> this is the firſt ſinne. Now when God complaines <hi>he was forſaken,</hi> his meaning is, that the people had wittingly and willingly reiected the yoke: for the like could not haue been affirmed of the profane nations. I grant if we haue reſpect to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſoone after the creation, all may bee condemned of forſaking of God, and of reuolting from him; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he manifeſted himſelfe to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the ſonnes of <hi>Noah:</hi> and when they fell afterwards into ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they were therein guilty of Apoſtaſie.

                     </note> Vnder one part he notes, that Gods ſeruice was peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and corrupted: in regard <hi>an oth</hi> (as wee ſaid yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) is a part, or one kind of Gods ſeruice. For as oft as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we ſweare by the name of God, we thereby <hi>make prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of our ſubiection</hi> vnder his authority; and that <hi>wee cannot eſcape vnpuniſhed if we lie.</hi> Secondly, wee attribute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vnto him this honour, <hi>that he is true.</hi> Thirdly, we thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> alſo profeſſe, <hi>that nothing is done without his priuity;</hi> but that all things are manifeſt before him.

                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>they committed adultery.</hi> This may bee taken metaphorically: but becauſe in the next verſe he inueyes vehemently againſt looſeneſſe, and adulteries, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this according to the letter, as they ſay. And yet I thinke it to be a ſimilitude, when he ſaith, <hi>they committed whoredome:</hi> in regard there was <hi>no ſpirituall chaſtity</hi> in them; howſoeuer the Lord for his part laboured to keepe them within compaſſe.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>and in the houſe of the harlot, they aſſembled.</hi> This may be taken as if the Iewes were tearmed the <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots houſe:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>The whole City of Ieruſalem, and the land of Iudeah is no better than a ſtewes.</hi> Others not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding expound it, that they aſſembled as into the harlots houſe: and thus he ſhould allude to their Temple.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7696:144"/> hatred.</hi> As in Pſal. 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all them that worke iniquity.</hi> Seeing it is ſo, it hence followes, that either hee muſt be pulled from his celeſtiall throne; or that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked muſt be puniſhed: who like wild colts, take the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in their teeth, and ceaſe not to adde ſinne vnto ſinne. As oft therfore as vaine flatteries ſhall come in our heads, and that Satan by his allurements, endeauours to make vs forget Gods iudgement; let it be remembred, <hi>that God ſhould not be God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God ſhould not be God, if he ſhould not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</note> 
                     <hi>vnleſſe he puniſh the iniquities of the ſons of men.</hi> It neceſſarily followes then, either that hee muſt puniſh, or be our enemy. Moreouer (as hath been ſaid) he ſhould not otherwiſe be conſtant; nay, hee ſhould (as it were) <hi>change his nature; whoſe nature (as we know) is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</hi> Where his hand therefore is already lifted vp to puniſh vs, there it is needfull that we preuent the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what ſhall be the meanes? We muſt learne to pronounce ſentence againſt our ſelues, and to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with our ſinnes: when there is ſuch a conuerſion, then God will ſhew vs mercy. And thus hee will pardon our ſinnes; <hi>not as if he approoued of them,</hi> or as if he ſtill exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed not the office of a Iudge: but (as I haue already ſaid) the doctrine of this verſe is properly directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that are vtterly rebellious; or to ſuch as the diuell hath ſo bewitched and dulled, as they paſſe not what become of them. In a word, this doctrine either makes the wicked cleane without excuſe, if they perſiſt in their obſtinacy: or rather, it ought to awaken ſuch as are not yet paſt cure; that in iudging themſelues now, they put it not off, till God reueales his wrath from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and to execute his laſt ſentence againſt them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere God, by the mouth of his Prophet, <hi>ſpeakes to the enemies,</hi> whoſe ſeruice hee meant to vſe, for the execution of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon the Iewes. Now this is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the Prophets, when they meane to gaule men to the quicke: for wee are not ignorant that there reſts in men a world of careleſneſſe, when God ſummons them before his iudgement ſeat. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then ſeeing he profited little, by a plaine manner of teaching, takes this courſe as ye ſee. In the <hi>perſon of God,</hi> he ſpeakes to the <hi>Chaldeans, and commands them to ſpeed themſelues to the ſiege of Ieruſalem.</hi> Thus the Prophets are wont to ſpeake: God will hiſſe for the flie that is in Egypt: or he will ſound a trumpet, and call the Caldeans, Iſa. 7.18.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7696:145"/> and 5.26. But this kind of figure hath much more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to wound mens hearts, when the Prophet, by Gods expreſſe charge, as an herald ſent from heauen, <hi>calles the enemie, and appoynts them out their taske; namely, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the whole City.</hi> In the firſt place hee ſaith, <hi>Climbe vp vpon the walles,</hi> whereby he ſignifies, that it is but in vaine for the Iewes, <hi>to truſt in the heighth of their walles;</hi> becauſe God will ſo aduance and lift vp their enemies, that <hi>the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> ſhall not be difficult vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Iewes thought themſelues ſafe, in regard the City was well defenced. But they ſhall be deceiued, ſaith he: thus then hee reprooues their folly, becauſe their walles ſhould bee inſufficient to ſaue them.</p>
                  <p>He further adds, <hi>make not an end.</hi> This clauſe is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two waies: for ſome take it in the good part, as if God ſhould mitigate the ſharpneſſe of this ſo great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.27.</note> as in the former chapter wee haue ſeene that ſome take it ſo. For albeit there, God affrights his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet (as they thinke) by way of correction hee adds, <hi>yet will I not make a conſumption:</hi> that is to ſay, there ſhall a remnant eſcape. The Prophets alſo are wont to ſpeake thus, when they meane to ſhew that ſome ſeed ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remaine, to the end the Church be not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. Thus now the expoſitors interpret it: as if God ſhould ſay, Ieruſalems ruine ſhall not bee ſo great, but the Church ſhall ſtill remain ſafe, in regard all ſhould not be conſumed. Others take the word heere vſed, for end: and this ſenſe agrees much better. For in this verſe God threatens to cut of the Iewes. Neither doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that which is ſaid elſewhere;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.22.</note> to wit, that there ſhould not be an vtter waſt or conſumption; in regard it is well enough knowne that the Prophets keepe not all one tenour in their ſpeeches. For when they denounce Gods iudgements againſt the reprobates, they leaue them without any hope at all. Which manner of ſpeech is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten met withall: <hi>I will make a conſumption.</hi> But in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpeech to the faithfull, they moderate this rigor
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7696:145"/> by way of correction; to wit, God will not make an vtter conſumption: I willingly therefore receiue their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who take the word <hi>conſumption</hi> in this place, for end; for the verbe whence this word is deriued, ſignifies to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. The ſenſe then will be, <hi>Deſtroy the City, and let there be none end;</hi> that is, raze it wholly. For forthwith it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the ſame ſenſe, <hi>take away her ſpreadings,</hi> or her branches: or as other tranſlate, The teeth of her walles; which are in the foundation. For wee know that walles are ſo built, that the foundation is alwayes the largeſt: and the word which the Prophet vſeth, ſignifies ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are extended euery way abroad. Thoſe who turne it iaggs, notches, wings, or battlements of the wals, ſeeme not to haue attained the Prophets meaning: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he ſpeakes not heere of the toppe of the walles, but of the foundations: as if hee ſhould ſay, ouerthrow her foundations, or raze the walles of the City. Why ſo? He adds,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They are not the Lords:</hi> for the Iewes were puffed vp with a vaine confidence, thinking they ſhould be hid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods protection: as if God (forſooth) would keepe their City, becauſe the Sanctuarie and the altar were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within the ſame. The Prophet therefore flatly denies, <hi>that the walles were the Lords,</hi> or that the foundations thereof were his. Neither may that which is ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where be alleaged to the contrary; namely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.1.</note> that God laid the foundations of this City.

                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.16.</note> as it is in <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> The prophet then refels this fottiſh confidence, wherewith the Iewes deceiued themſelues: for they thought that God (after a ſort) was ſo bound and tied vnto them, as hee could neuer ceaſe to bee the guardian of the City. Hee ſaith then, that <hi>their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were none of Gods:</hi> for the Iewes had ſo profaned this place by their wickedneſſes, that God could not
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7696:146"/> endure to dwell in ſuch a dunghill. It followes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Why Gods word is compared here to fier.</note> not as in other places, nor for the ſame end: but there is a ſpeciall cauſe of this ſimilitude heere, to wit, that the words of the Prophets ſhould conſume the people, as the fier conſumes dry wood, or ſtubble. The word of God is elſewhere tearmed burning, or flaming, in regard it inflames the hearts of men; and becauſe it purgeth out, and conſumes away their droſſineſſe. But the queſtion heere, is neither of the vtility which the word brings with it, nor of the fruit which the faithfull reape from it. For God ſimply denounceth, <hi>that the Prophets doctrine ſhall be the ruine of the people:</hi> and therefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaith, <hi>I will put my words in thy mouth, as a fier.</hi> Had he onely ſaid, Behold, my words ſhall bee as the fier, and this people as the ſtubble; this had not been cleere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But in regard the Iewes had now accuſtomed themſelues to diſdainfull ſcoffings: And (I pray you) what are theſe Prophets? and what are their big and high words? words that onely beate the aire. Becauſe the Iewes (I ſay) accuſtomed themſelues to theſe contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſpeeches: therefore the Lord on the contrary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, <hi>Behold, I will put my words in thy mouth:</hi> that is to ſay, Thy tongue ſhall bee more than ſufficient to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and root out this people. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> then teacheth the ſame here, which <hi>Paul</hi> doth in other words, 2. Cor. 10.4.5 We haue vengeance ready againſt euery high thing that exalts it ſelfe againſt the Goſpel of God. For this vice hath raigned in all ages: namely, men haue either little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, or rather vtterly contemned Gods ſeruants. Now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeing the Goſpell deſpiſed of many, ſaith, that he, and his fellow-miniſters <hi>had vengeance ready:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, all the words we vtter, ſhall bee as ſo many ſwords to ouerthrow and deſtroy the wicked; though now through their malepertneſſe they dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe Gods iudgement: ſuch a rebellion ſhall ſtand them in no ſtead. They then, ſhall feele no leſſe efficacie in my words, then if God from heauen had openly diſcouered
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7696:149"/> his arme vnto them, and had thence thundred downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads. And this is <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> meaning in this place: <hi>Behold ſaith the Lord, I will put my words in thy mouth as a fier:</hi> that is, there ſhall bee ſuch force in thy words, that the wicked ſhall well perceiue to their coſt, that thou art the executioner of my vengeance.</p>
                  <p>We ought aduiſedly to bethinke vs of the doctrine of this place, leſt by our ingratitude wee prouoke Gods wrath ſo to be kindled againſt vs,<note place="margin">The word of God by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe, may become a fier to conſume vs, which in it ſelfe is food to feede vs.</note> that we cauſe his word to be conuerted <hi>into fier,</hi> which otherwiſe is ordained <hi>for our food.</hi> For to what purpoſe doth God ſend vs the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Goſpell, but to allure vs to life eternall, and heereby ſweetly to feed and refreſh our ſoules? The word of God therefore is vnto vs as the <hi>water,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our ſoules are <hi>beſprinkled and waſhed.</hi> It is indeed as <hi>a fier</hi> vnto vs; but for our good. It is a <hi>fier,</hi> but it is to <hi>purge out our droſſe;</hi> not to conſume vs. If wee then ſhall dare proudly to contemne this fier, what will follow, but that it be turned to the cleane contrary vſe; namely, to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure</hi> and vtterly conſume vs?</p>
                  <p>Now he ſaith, <hi>the people ſhall be as wood,</hi> in regard the wicked, all the while they obſtinately bend their iron brow againſt God, thinke thereby to make his vengeance to recoyle a farre off from them.

But we haue formerly aduertiſed you, that all Gods rods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the efficacie of the word.

In another place we ſhall ſee how God ſends <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to lay ſiege to the City: but with what power? None but himſelfe alone, without any munition at all. True: but this was a myſtery to the reprobate: and yet had it, its effect. <hi>For as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpake, ſo did God execute that which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> We ſee heere then, that the Caldeans <hi>came as it were out of Ieremiahs mouth,</hi> euen as if the enemy minding to batter the walles of a City, ſhould ſhoot againſt it, and play vpon the walles with Canon ſhot: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we at this day haue new engins, and inuentions for ſtratagems of warre, to batter and raze Cities: what are then all <hi>the engins of warre?</hi> They are the <hi>fier,</hi> which God caſts out by the mouthes of his ſeruants, and the doctrine by them taught,<note place="margin">The word of God hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force in it, than is in all the engines of war.</note> brings forthwith with it, all the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of warre that can be inuented; not onely to deſtroy a City and people, but the whole world alſo, as oft as neede ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> then, <hi>will bring vpon you, O houſe of Iſrael, a nation from farre.</hi> We haue told you elſewhere, why the Prophet notes out <hi>this diſtance of place;</hi> namely, becauſe the Iewes imagined they were ſafe enough, in regard of theſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo farre remote from them: as at this day, if one ſhould tell vs of the inuaſion of the Turkes: wee would reply, Oh, they haue enough to doe with many of other

Hee now ſaith then, <hi>this land was yours.</hi> No doubt but in that hee thus calles his benefits beſtowed vpon them to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, it was to aggrauate their vnthankfulneſſe, in regard they were the iuſt and lawfull poſſeſſors of this land,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.3.</note> which yet was none of their conqueſt. Hee ſaith, <hi>they ſerued ſtrange gods in their land:</hi> and not onely that, <hi>but ſtrangers alſo.</hi> The Prophets ſpeake often thus: they call them the gods of the ſtranger, or of a ſtrange nation: but the phraſe of ſpeech hath great waight in it; becauſe it is an vnworthy thing, and much leſſe excuſable, <hi>that the Iewes who had God dwelling in the middeſt of them, ſhould by way of borrowing, ſeeke after the gods (heere and there) of profane nations:</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Giue yee vs your gods.

Why ſo? The whole world ſeemes to be turned topſie turuey, when her waues ariſe with ſo great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: who is it that heares or ſees the ſame, that trembles not euery ioynt of him:<note place="margin">Though the ſea be neuer ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, yet it obeyes God quietly.</note> and yet the ſea it ſelfe, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the moſt reſolute man on earth; <hi>obeyes God quietly.</hi> For let her flouds be neuer ſo furious, yet doe they grow calme and ſtill, and keepe within compaſſe. But if you would know the manner how; truly it is a miracle; and therefore who can giue a reaſon of it? For the ſea wee
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7696:155"/> know (as other elements are) is round: as the earth is round, ſo is the element of water; and ſo is the fier and aire in like manner. Sith the forme of this element then is round, let vs ſee whether it be lower than the earth, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue it: but her lightneſſe ſhewes, that ſhe is aboue the earth. Whence is it then,<note place="margin">The cauſe why the ſea ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmes not the whole world. See Iob <hi>38.11.</hi>
                     </note> that the ſea doth not forthwith ouerwhelme the whole earth? For ſhe is liquid, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay in a place, vnleſſe ſhe be reſtrained by ſome ſecret power &amp; mouing of God. It followes then, that the ſea is ſhut vp within her place, becauſe it hath ſo pleaſed God: as <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo ſhewes in Geneſ. 1.9. <hi>Let the dry earth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,</hi> ſaith God. For he there ſhewes that the earth was couered with waters, ſo as not a fingers bredth thereof appeared, till God had gathered them into their place. Now <hi>this voice of God,</hi> albeit <hi>we heare it not</hi> with our eares, and that it ſounds not in the aire; <hi>yet doth the ſea vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it well enough;</hi> becauſe ſhe is contained within her bounds. <hi>Put the caſe the ſea ſhould alwayes be calme,</hi> yet ſhould this worke of God at all times be admirable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard men haue <hi>ſome part of the earth dry,</hi> wherein they may inhabite. But when the tempeſt riſeth, as I haue ſaid, and that it ſeemes heauen and earth would goe together: which of vs trembles not at the viewing of ſuch a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Then Gods power and out-ſtretched arme appeares more manifeſtly, which thus compoſeth and quiets the boyſterous ſea. Wee now ſee the ſcope of the Prophets words. He ſhewes that the Iewes are become <hi>monſters,</hi> and vnworthy to bee reckoned among men; no, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the brute beaſts. <hi>For there is more vnderſtanding in the ſea, toſſed with furious tempeſts; than in men, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be endowed with ſenſe and reaſon.</hi> This is the drift and ſcope of this compariſon.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this complaint was very bitter, the Prophet hath vſed <hi>an interrogation: Will ye not feare me?</hi> As if God ſhould ſay, What meanes this? Is it poſſible that I ſhould not be feared, nor reuerenced of you? The ſea obeyes me, and by my ſecret command her fury is ſtaid; becauſe I
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7696:156"/> haue once ordained ſhee ſhould keepe within her limits: and albeit ſhe be violently toſſed vp and downe with her waues and tempeſts; yet doth ſhe not paſſe beyond the bounds which I haue ſet her. And O yee ſonnes of men that are reaſonable creatures! <hi>will not yee feare me? will not yee tremble, or feare before my face?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>that hee hath placed the ſand for a bound to the ſea.</hi> Now this expreſſeth much more, than if he had ſaid, I haue ordained limits for the ſea. For hee ſpeakes of the <hi>ſand which is moueable,</hi> and with a little blaſt is caried this way and that way. The <hi>ſand</hi> alſo is eaſie to be pierced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? Were there <hi>hard rockes placed vpon all the ſea bankes,</hi> the miracle would not be halfe ſo admirable. If God then ſhould beate backe the ſwellings of the ſea with ſuch things as were <hi>of a ſolide ſubſtance;</hi> this worke might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture be aſcribed to nature. <hi>But what ſolidneſſe is in the ſand?</hi> Let me powre but a little water vpon it, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently it pierceth into it. Whence comes it then, that the boyſterous ſea, with her roaring waues, <hi>plowes not vp</hi> the ſand, which of its owne nature is ſo flexible? Wee ſee then, that this word <hi>ſand</hi> is not ſuperfluous. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the like place to this, in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 38.11. where God ſpeaking of his inuinſible power, among other things, ſaith, And let the ſea come hitherto: let her proud waues paſſe no further. For it is moſt certaine, that the leaſt tempeſt ariſeth not, but by Gods will. Why ſo? Becauſe he can alwayes hold the ſea at one rate. But hee doth it not: nay rather, as if he laid the raines in her neck, he ſaith, <hi>Goe: but yet ſtay heere.</hi> Now when it ſeemes theſe great waues mounted aloft as high as the mountaines, threaten both men &amp; beaſts, as if the whole earth ſhould therewithall bee ouerwhelmed: then doe theſe violent waues ſuddenly ceaſe, and are calme.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Eſterday wee ſet before you the brutiſh careleſneſſe of ſuch as are ſo little affected with Gods benefits, that they are not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp thereby to honour and ſerue him. I grant the Prophet <hi>ſpake of ſuch benefits as God beſtowes equally, as well vpon the bad, as vpon the good:</hi> to wit, he giues them ſhowers, <hi>the ſpring time, and harueſt;</hi> and ſo diſpoſeth of all the parts and ſeaſons of the yeere, that at the length the fruits of the earth ripen. For by <hi>the weekes ordained,</hi> or eſtabliſhed, hee ſimply meanes, that God in ſuch wiſe orders euery part of the yeere, <hi>that whatſoeuer men ſowe, ripens at laſt.</hi> And the word, <hi>reſerues;</hi> tends alſo to the ſame purpoſe: for it is all one as if he had ſaid, The ſeaſons ſo change euery yeere, that yet one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall courſe and order is ſtill obſerued, and they follow (as you ſee) one in the necke of another. Now wee haue the Prophets meaning: for hee ſhewes, that the Iewes had too long been beſotted, and brutiſhly minded; in that they conſidered not, no not in their ordinaty and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food, of Gods bounty and liberality towards them, which yet ought to haue been as ſo many goads in their ſides, to haue pricked them forward to his feare and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo (in his time) preaching to profane perſons, Act. 14.17. ſets this conſideration before their eyes, <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neuer left himſelfe without witneſſe, in that he gaue you raine and fruitfull ſeaſons:</hi> that is, hee ſo diſpoſed of the ſeaſons, that one might eaſily behold therein, as in a glaſſe, his fatherly loue towards mankind. But the Prophet meant heere to taxe the Iewes of <hi>ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:7696:158"/> in regard they conſidered not how liberally God had alwayes dealt with them, and that not after an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner. For he had not onely drawne them to him, by beſtowing common benefits vpon them; but had alſo obliged them to him, by rare and vnaccuſtomed mercies. Seeing then he had beſtowed extraordinary fauours vpon them, ſo much the more odious was their vnthankfulnes, in regard they conſidered not in themſelues, that all the benefits they had receiued at his hands, were as ſo many ſpurs in their ſides, or allurements to bind them vnto him. This is the Prophets meaning then, when he ſaith, <hi>They ſaid not, Let vs now feare the Lord, which giues vs raine:</hi> that is, the raine of the ſpring, and the raine before harueſt; and that in due time time and ſeaſon. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſee how the prouidence of God ſhineth: namely, whileſt the husband-man ſowes, the raine flowes; which miniſtreth moiſture and iuyce vnto the earth: moreouer, before the fruits be ripened, how God again breathes fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into them, by this raine of the euening. And that which followes, tends to the ſame end; who giues raines in <hi>the weekes ordained:</hi> or, word for word, of ordinances. But he adds, <hi>that at length the harueſt may approch.</hi>

                     <hi>But know, it comes to paſſe by reaſon of your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and peruerſity, that God tempers not euery part of the yeere in ſuch wiſe, as with your eyes you may behold his continuall liberality.

Thence it comes, that profane perſons thinke the barrenneſſe of this yeere, and the fruitfulneſſe of that; falles out by chance. For in this life we ſee nothing ſo conſtantly to goe on in a ſtright line, as if the goodneſſe of God ſo manifeſted it ſelfe in all things, that there ſhould not now and then happen many obſtacles and hinderances in the way. But which of vs conſiders, whence this trouble and confuſion proceeds? Doubtleſſe it is, becauſe our ſelues haue ſhut vp the way againſt God, that his bounty ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reach vnto vs:<note place="margin">Note.</note> we trouble heauen and earth then by our ſins. For if wee kept our ſelues within the bounds of obedience to our God, certainly all the elements would bee continually for vs: and thus wee ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an Angelicall harmony in all the parts of the world. But in regard we by our iniquities raiſe vp tumults euery day againſt God; yea euery day proclaime open warre againſt him, and by our pride, contumacy, and obſtinacy prouoke him: all things, as well in the heauens, as in the earth, <hi>muſt needs be out of ſquare.</hi> Hence it comes, that the skie is darkened ouer vs, and that continuall raines marre the fruits of the earth, and that wee ſee no right order in any part of the world. This ſo confuſed a diſtemperature then, which we diſcerne in all the elements, muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>to our ſinnes;</hi> for that is the Prophets meaning.</p>
                  <p>Now this reprehenſion, no doubt, was then directed
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7696:159"/> to the Iewes; but wee may gather a generall doctrine from it. Theſe two poynts then ſtand firme: firſt,<note place="margin">Two points.</note> that God leaues not himſelfe without witneſſe; in regard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he giues raine, and faire weather: hee makes the earth fruitfull, to the end it may miniſter food for our vſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the aire, the firmament, and the earth, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſtempered, many things falling out vnſeaſonably; as if God were careleſſe of vs. Becauſe when wee by our ſins riſe vp againſt him; we confound and ouerturne the whole order of nature.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>we may behold an ineſtimabe goodneſſe of God towards mankind: but in the mutations which fall out, we muſt forthwith conſider of the cauſe; namely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Lord to keepe one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeaſons of the yeere.</note> 
                     <hi>that we will not permit God to gouerne the world after a certaine and equall rate; but wee diſturbe his prouidence, as much as lies in vs.</hi> Now we ſee then, that the Prophet hath very aptly added this ſentence to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>your iniquities haue hindred Gods bleſſings and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from you.</hi> Then it followes.</p>

                  <p>HE now confirmes his laſt ſpeech, namely, that the Iewes by their owne fault, depriued themſelues of Gods fatherly fauour. Otherwiſe, they would alwayes haue had their replies ready: for as hypocrites are facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lofty, ſo will they not endure to be eaſily brought vnder. The Prophet then confirmes that which bee ſaid, to wit, <hi>that there were wicked perſons found among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, we need not now ſeeke out wicked ones among the profane heathen: for iniquity ſo raignes euen amongſt vs <hi>the elect people</hi> of God, that there is nothing ſound nor ſincere amongſt vs.</p>
                  <p>When he ſaith, <hi>they were found</hi> I expound it, that they were taken with the manner, and conuicted. For his
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7696:160"/> meaning is, that their wickedneſſes were not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo cloſely and obſcurely, that they could ſhift off the matter by their euaſions:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See chap.</hi> 2.26.</note> 
                     <hi>for they were found,</hi> ſaith he, as theeues that are taken breaking into mens houſes. The Prophet affirmes then, that there was no need here, of any long diſpute, or trauerſing the matter; as if the Iewes had been ſome way excuſable: <hi>for they were taken with the deed doing.</hi> This then was much more odious, then if the poore blind Heathen had been found guilty of theſe things. For God had adopted the Iewes vpon condition, that all holineſſe and integrity of life ſhould raigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Seeing then on the contrary, they were not onely ſinners, but wholly wrapt in ſinne, and full fraught with impieties: this (as I haue ſaid) was much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable. And thus he hath ſtripped them of all occaſion of cauelling.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he preſſeth them yet neerer; namely, <hi>that euery one looked.</hi> For the word in the Prophets lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſignifies ſo much. <hi>He ſhall looke.</hi> I grant hee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the number, but the ſenſe is not therefore obſcure. Now the word, <hi>to looke,</hi> heere, ſignifies as much as to lay ambuſhes. <hi>He ſhall looke</hi> then, that is to ſay, euery one of them watched and eſpied how, and which way they might lay traps, as fowlers doe.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he ſaith, <hi>they were furniſhed with nets,</hi> to draw men into ruine, after they had ſnared them. Heere <hi>one kind is put for the generall.</hi> For the Prophet meant to to ſhew, that at that time, there was neither faith nor vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe to be found among this people, in regard eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one oppreſſed the ſimple, by wicked ſubtilties, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning practices. Being growne thus perfidious then, and in that they dealt ſo trecherouſly one with another; he iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compares them <hi>to fowlers,</hi> who catch the poore birds in their nets, or gins.

Now in this verſe, <hi>hee applies this ſimilitude</hi> to the Iewes: to wit, <hi>that their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were as full of fraud, as a cage</hi> (others tranſlate, a panyer, or basket) <hi>is of birds.</hi> For when fowlers go to their game, they carry with them either <hi>bags, cages,</hi> or <hi>baskets.</hi> Thus <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſaith then, that they got in their booty in ſuch wiſe on all ſides, that their houſes were full of fraud. Now by the word <hi>deceit,</hi> in this place, hee meanes the ſpoyles which they obtained by cunning practiſes. Indeed, at the firſt bluſh the ſpeech ſeemes ſomewhat obſcure: but if we take the word <hi>fraud,</hi> in the paſſiue ſignification, there will be no ambiguity at all. The Prophet then (to ſpeake properly) ſaith not that their houſes were full of craft, or fraud, <hi>but of ſpoyles which they had gotten to themſelues by fraud and deceit.</hi> What meanes hee then by this word <hi>fraud?</hi> He meanes the <hi>ſpoyles</hi> wherewith they enriched themſelues; as we ſhall ſee by his owne expoſition anon. Wee haue now attained the Prophets meaning then, namely, <hi>that proofes need not be ſought out a farre off,</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt whether the Iewes deceiued the poore and ſimple, by their crafty conueyances: <hi>for their houſes</hi> were full of ſuch booties, that thence their peruerſity might eaſily bee eſpied; in regard they had gotten riches on all ſides, and by this meanes had ſpoyled poore men of their ſubſtance. For which cauſe he adds,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heereupon they are encreaſed, and enriched.</hi> For it is likely they bragged much of their riches; as theeues and robbers, that care not whom they ſpoyle. For being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and growne great, they thought themſelues farre excluded out of the common ſort of men: as theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7696:161"/> who hauing ſnatched their riches from this and that man by fraud, and by a tyrannous vſurpation, ſo as one will be able to diſpend ſixty thouſand by the yeere;<note place="margin">Courtiers taxed, who ſuddenly riſe to wealth by oppreſſion.</note> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an hundred thouſand: then grow they to be ſo much the more proud and diſdainfull, in regard they thinke no man ought to call them to an account: for their eyes are dazled with the great ſplendor and glory of their riches. But the Prophet deriding this vaine and fond glorying, ſaith, <hi>Behold they are become great in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be magnified:</hi> but ſaith he; <hi>they are encreaſed and enriched:</hi> That is to ſay, If any now doe but ſearch their houſes, I grant he ſhall finde goodly and ſwelling titles there, by meanes whereof they beguiled poore ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people: but in the meane while all are but the ſpoyles, booties, and robberies of theeues.

                  <p>THe Prophet not contenting himſelfe with his former reprehenſion, paſſeth yet further, in reprouing the faults and iniquities of his nation. He ſaith then, the eſtate of the Iewes <hi>was ſo corrupt,</hi> that the whole world might <hi>be aſtoniſhed</hi> at it. <hi>A fearfull thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is fallen out:</hi> that is, a thing paſt the reach of mans wit or reaſon, to imagine or comprehend. By theſe <hi>two words</hi> he ſignifies, that the impiety of the people cannot be expreſſed with words, or conceiued in the mind of man, becauſe it is an horrible monſter. This is the ſumme. Let vs now ſee what that deteſtable thing is, which the Prophet heere notes out, and ſo deteſts: <hi>The Prophets</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>propheſied lies.</hi> It is certain that this might well aſtoniſh any that ſhould heare of it, that in Ieruſalem (the City which God had
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7696:163"/> choſen for his dwelling place end ſanctuarie) theſe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſhould dare to pretend the name of <hi>Prophets.</hi> What an horrible profanation of Gods name was this? Theſe impoſtors (forſooth) muſt haue it bruted euery where, that they were <hi>the Prophets of God.</hi> In many places there were Oracles; that is to ſay, illuſions of Satan: but to ſee and behold in the Sanctuarie of God (there being then but one in all the world) the miniſters of Satan, <hi>to ſowe lies,</hi> which ſhould bring the people to perdition, and in the meane while to colour all vnder Gods name; who (as I haue ſaid) had his dwelling and his ſeat royall in this City: was it not an horrible monſter that might aſtoniſh all the world. And albeit euen at this day it be a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable for the Monkes, and thoſe ſinkes, to get vp into pulpits to preach, and wickedly to glory, as if they were Gods true Prophets, and faithfull teachers: yet if amongſt vs it ſhould fal out,<note place="margin">They are double monſters, who dare teach lies, where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is purely preached.</note> that ſome one ſhould corrupt the pure doctrine with their errours, and infect, our people with their ſuperſtitions, he were <hi>a double monſter.</hi> It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe then, that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſaith, it was a thing both fearfull, and incomprehenſible, <hi>that the Prophets prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he adds, <hi>the Prieſts take in their hands;</hi> ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it thus: but the ſenſe may bee double. It is ſaid in Iudges, 14.9. that <hi>Sampſon</hi> tooke honey with his hands, out of the Lion; where the ſame word is is vſed. And yet becauſe ordinarily &amp; for the moſt part, it is taken to rule; me thinks the other expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agrees better; to wit, <hi>that the Prieſts ruled by the hands of the falſe prophets.</hi> Now albeit we tranſlate thus, <hi>they tooke vpon their hands,</hi> that is, they got in, and heaped together gifts on all ſides: this alſo will not be much vnapt. How euer it be, <hi>the Prophet ſhewes there was a mutual colluſion practiſed betweene the Priesſts, and the falſe prophets,</hi> ſo as they held both together. For the falſe prophets (ſaith he) deceiued the people by their flatteries. But what did the Prieſts? For they ought to haue oppoſed againſt them: but <hi>O, they receiued</hi>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:7696:163"/> (ſaith he) <hi>in their hands:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>they winked at it; becauſe they ſaw theſe iuglings made for their aduantage: and thus the agreement was eaſily made vp betweene them,</hi> and the falſe Prophets. We ſee the very ſame at this day in the Papacie: for whileſt rhe Monkes, and that rabble, ſeeke to creepe into the peoples fauour, they thereby vphold and maintaine the whole Popedome. For which cauſe theſe curres, haue alſo dared to tearme themſelues,<note place="margin">The Popes Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots vpon which he is carried: to wit, the foure orders of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friars.</note> the Popes chariots. For the Pope, ſay they, is carried vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>foure wheeles:</hi> theſe foure wheeles are the foure orders of beging Friars: and this they boaſt of, <hi>when they meane to ſhew what power they haue to lie.</hi> The Pope then is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vpon theſe foure wheeles of beggars. We ſee alſo he hath adorned, and euery day adornes theſe beggars. Why ſo? Becauſe they beare vp his tyranny. Such, at that time, was the condition of this people: for the <hi>Prieſts</hi> tooke the prey, and <hi>the falſe Prophets</hi> alſo raked to them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, as theſe hungry dogs doe at this day: and yet theſe dogs ſet not vpon the people with ſuch violence as the Pope doth: but like dogs, they licke vp his ſtoole. He with his horned Biſhops, deuoure the beſt and the fatteſt part. This ſenſe then, ye ſee agrees not ill; to wit, that they took in their hands. But as touching the ſumme, it will alſo agree very well, if we ſay, <hi>that the Prieſts ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their hands,</hi> in regard their ſtate would not haue ſtood vpright, neither could they haue retained their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and reputation among the people, without theſe falſe prophets: for they were reiected of all. Seeing then, they raigned (as it were) by their hands, there was a mutuall compact betweene them.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>and my people will haue it ſo;</hi> becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people might eaſily (as they thought) exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from all blame: for euen ſo it is their cuſtome at this day, to ſhroud themſelues vnder this defence: Alas, we are poore ſilly men, we were neuer at the ſchooles, we are none of theſe great Clerkes: and what would ye haue vs to doe, but follow our Prelates?

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>26</label> ſuch, as reſtrained their thankes from him: they were not to thinke it ſtrange. They might thanke themſelues for it. p. <hi>304. 305.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For their wickedneſſes were growne ſo apparant, that the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>27</label> very fact it ſelfe conuinced them thereof; to their very faces. p. <hi>305. 306.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shewing, that Fowlers cages are not commonly more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with birds, than their houſes were filled with the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>28</label> booties they had filſhed from the poore, by their craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties. p. <hi>307.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was this to be found among the common ſort: but among the Iudges and Magiſtrates: who becauſe they were <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>29</label> growne great by their oppreſſions, neglected the cauſe of the poore and fatherleſſe in iudgement. p. <hi>309.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which purpoſe he takes vp his ſpeech againe, vſed verſ. <hi>9</hi> which ſhewes, that the Iewes were growne to be ſo hardened in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>30</label> ſinne, that God muſt at once auenge himſelfe vpon them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſhould ceaſe to be the iuſt Iudge of the world. p. <hi>310.</hi>
               </p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>31</label> As before he had taxed them in the Magiſtracy: ſo now by way of admiration at ſo horrible an impiety, he taxeth them in the Miniſtery, both Prieſts and Prophets; in that by their flatteries and lies, they made the people their prey: who yet were willing enough (for their parts) to be ſo abuſed by them. p. <hi>311. 312. 313.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concluding the whole with this; that ſeeing there was ſuch diſorder among all ſorts, both high and low; therefore they must in the end, looke for a miſerable downefall. p. <hi>314. 315.</hi>
